```solidity
// Smart contract with Uninitialized Storage Pointer vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UninitializedStoragePointer {
    
    uint256 public data;
    
    function setData(uint256 _data) public {
        UninitializedStruct uninitializedStruct;
        uninitializedStruct.value = _data;
        data = uninitializedStruct.value;
    }
    
    struct UninitializedStruct {
        uint256 value;
    }
}
```

In the smart contract `UninitializedStoragePointer` above, the `UninitializedStruct` struct is declared inside the `setData` function without being initialized. When the `setData` function is called, the `UninitializedStruct` struct is treated as a storage variable and points to the storage slot of the contract. This can lead to unintended changes in the storage variables of the contract.

### Remediation:

To remediate the Uninitialized Storage Pointer vulnerability, you should explicitly define the data location for the struct variable to be `memory` instead of `storage`. This ensures that the struct variable is treated as a memory variable and does not point to the storage slot of the contract.

Here is the remediated version of the smart contract:

```solidity
// Remediated Smart contract for Uninitialized Storage Pointer vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract RemediatedUninitializedStoragePointer {
    
    uint256 public data;
    
    function setData(uint256 _data) public {
        UninitializedStruct memory uninitializedStruct;
        uninitializedStruct.value = _data;
        data = uninitializedStruct.value;
    }
    
    struct UninitializedStruct {
        uint256 value;
    }
}
```

In the remediated version, the `UninitializedStruct` struct is explicitly defined with the data location `memory` to ensure that it does not point to the storage slot of the contract. This helps prevent unintended changes to the storage variables of the contract.
