Below is a vulnerable smart contract that has the Call to the Unknown vulnerability:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        (bool success, ) = _newOwner.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("receiveOwnership()"));
        require(success, "Ownership transfer failed");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
}
```

In the `transferOwnership` function of the `VulnerableContract`, the `_newOwner` address is used in a `call` function with an unknown function signature `receiveOwnership()`. This can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the `_newOwner` address is a smart contract that does not have a `receiveOwnership()` function.

### Remediation:

To remediate the Call to the Unknown vulnerability, you should follow these best practices:

1. **Use Interface**: Define an interface that specifies the functions that the `_newOwner` smart contract must implement. This way, you ensure that the function being called is known and exists in the smart contract.

```solidity
interface IOwnership {
    function receiveOwnership() external;
}

contract VulnerableContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        IOwnership newOwnerContract = IOwnership(_newOwner);
        newOwnerContract.receiveOwnership();
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
}
```

2. **Use Known Function Signature**: If you cannot use an interface, make sure to specify the exact function signature that the `_newOwner` smart contract should have. This ensures that the function being called is known and prevents unexpected behavior.

```solidity
contract VulnerableContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        (bool success, ) = _newOwner.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("receiveOwnership()"));
        require(success, "Ownership transfer failed");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
}
```

By following these remediation steps, you can mitigate the Call to the Unknown vulnerability in your smart contract.
