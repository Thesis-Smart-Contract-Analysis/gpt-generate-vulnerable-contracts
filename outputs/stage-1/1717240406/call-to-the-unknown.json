This can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the `_newOwner` address is a smart contract that does not have a `receiveOwnership()` function.\n\n### Remediation:\n\nTo remediate the Call to the Unknown vulnerability, you should follow these best practices:\n\n1. **Use Interface**: Define an interface that specifies the functions that the `_newOwner` smart contract must implement. This way, you ensure that the function being called is known and exists in the smart contract.\n\n```solidity\ninterface IOwnership {\n    function receiveOwnership() external;\n}\n\ncontract VulnerableContract {\n    address public owner;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can transfer ownership\");\n        IOwnership newOwnerContract = IOwnership(_newOwner);\n        newOwnerContract.receiveOwnership();\n        owner = _newOwner;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. **Use Known Function Signature**: If you cannot use an interface, make sure to specify the exact function signature that the `_newOwner` smart contract should have. This ensures that the function being called is known and prevents unexpected behavior.\n\n```solidity\ncontract VulnerableContract {\n    address public owner;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can transfer ownership\");\n        (bool success, ) = _newOwner.call(abi.encodeWithSignature(\"receiveOwnership()\"));\n        require(success, \"Ownership transfer failed\");\n        owner = _newOwner;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy following these remediation steps, you can mitigate the Call to the Unknown vulnerability in your smart contract."
