This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1:** Remove one of the constructor functions and consolidate the initialization logic into a single constructor.\n- **Remediation 2:** Use an initializer function pattern along with a flag to ensure that initialization logic is only executed once.\n\nBy addressing the Double Constructor vulnerability, you can enhance the security and integrity of your smart contract."
