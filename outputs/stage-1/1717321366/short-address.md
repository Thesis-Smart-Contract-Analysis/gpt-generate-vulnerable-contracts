# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract ShortAddressVulnerability {

  function withdrawFunds(address _recipient, uint _amount) public {
    require(_recipient.call.value(_amount)());
  }

}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the above smart contract:
The vulnerability in the `withdrawFunds` function lies in the usage of the `call` function with the `value` parameter. When an address with a short length than expected is passed as `_recipient`, it can lead to unexpected behavior due to the way Ethereum pads addresses to 20 bytes.

# Remediations

- Use the `transfer` function instead of `call.value` to send Ether to an address. The `transfer` function automatically handles the correct amount of gas and reverts the transaction if the transfer fails.
- Implement additional checks to ensure the length of the address passed to the function is correct before proceeding with the transfer.
