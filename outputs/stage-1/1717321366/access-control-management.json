Anyone can call this function and withdraw funds without being the owner.\n\n# Description\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the `withdrawFunds` function where it only checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner` before allowing the transfer of funds. This lack of proper access control allows any address to call the function and withdraw funds.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Explicitly define the `owner` variable and implement proper access control mechanisms.\n- Use modifiers like `onlyOwner` to restrict access to critical functions.\n- Implement a role-based access control system to manage different levels of access within the smart contract."
