# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract InsufficientGasGriefing {
    
    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender.call.value(1 ether)());
    }
    
}
```

The vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function where the contract sends 1 ether to the caller without checking the return value of the `call` function. This can lead to a reentrancy attack where the recipient contract can consume more gas than expected, causing the transaction to revert.

# Remediations

- Use the `transfer` function instead of `call.value` to send Ether to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- Implement a check to ensure the `call` function returns `true` before proceeding with the Ether transfer.
