This can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Ensure that the base contract is inherited before the derived contract in the inheritance list.\n- Correct the inheritance order by placing `IncorrectInheritanceOrder` after `MaliciousContract` in the contract definition."
