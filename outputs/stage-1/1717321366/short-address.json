When an address with a short length than expected is passed as `_recipient`, it can lead to unexpected behavior due to the way Ethereum pads addresses to 20 bytes.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Use the `transfer` function instead of `call.value` to send Ether to an address. The `transfer` function automatically handles the correct amount of gas and reverts the transaction if the transfer fails.\n- Implement additional checks to ensure the length of the address passed to the function is correct before proceeding with the transfer."
