# Smart contract with Access Control Management vulnerability

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract AccessControlVulnerable {
  
  function withdrawFunds() {
    require(msg.sender == owner);
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }

}
```

In the above smart contract `AccessControlVulnerable`, the `withdrawFunds` function does not have proper access control management. Anyone can call this function and withdraw funds without being the owner.

# Description

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawFunds` function where it only checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner` before allowing the transfer of funds. This lack of proper access control allows any address to call the function and withdraw funds.

# Remediations

- Explicitly define the `owner` variable and implement proper access control mechanisms.
- Use modifiers like `onlyOwner` to restrict access to critical functions.
- Implement a role-based access control system to manage different levels of access within the smart contract.
