# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

The vulnerability lies in the line `require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);` where the function `withdrawWinnings` is using the `msg.sender` address directly without explicit visibility. This can lead to unintended behavior where anyone can call the `_sendWinnings` function without the intended condition being met.

# Remediations

- Explicitly define the visibility of functions to prevent unintended access. For example, change `function withdrawWinnings() {` to `function withdrawWinnings() public {`.
- Ensure that sensitive functions are properly restricted and not accessible by unauthorized parties.
