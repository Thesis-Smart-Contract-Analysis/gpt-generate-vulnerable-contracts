# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract IdentityVerificationVulnerable {
  
  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0); // Vulnerability in this line
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

## Description

The vulnerability in the smart contract `IdentityVerificationVulnerable` lies in the `withdrawWinnings` function where the identity verification is based on the last 8 hex characters of the caller's address being equal to 0. However, due to the implicit visibility of the function, anyone can call this function and potentially bypass the intended verification.

## Remediations

- Explicitly define the visibility of the `withdrawWinnings` function as `public` to prevent unintended access.
- Implement a more secure and robust identity verification mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can withdraw winnings.
