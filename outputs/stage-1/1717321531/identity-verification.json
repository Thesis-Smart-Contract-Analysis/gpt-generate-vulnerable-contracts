However, due to the implicit visibility of the function, anyone can call this function and potentially bypass the intended verification.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- Explicitly define the visibility of the `withdrawWinnings` function as `public` to prevent unintended access.\n- Implement a more secure and robust identity verification mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can withdraw winnings."
