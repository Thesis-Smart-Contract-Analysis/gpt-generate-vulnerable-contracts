However, the function does not update the user's balance before transferring the ETH, which can lead to a re-entrancy vulnerability. An attacker can call the `attack` function, which in turn calls the `withdraw` function of another target address. If the target address is a malicious contract that calls back into the `ReentrancyVulnerable` contract before the balance is updated, the attacker can repeatedly withdraw funds without decrementing their balance.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- Ensure that state changes are made before any external calls, especially transfers of ETH.\n- Implement a check-effect-interaction pattern where state changes are made before interacting with external contracts.\n- Consider using the Withdrawal Pattern to separate the state update and the transfer of funds to prevent re-entrancy attacks."
