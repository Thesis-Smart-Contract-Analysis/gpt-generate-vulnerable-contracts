# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UninitializedStoragePointer {
    uint256 public data;

    function setData() public {
        uint256 localData;
        data = localData; // Uninitialized Storage Pointer vulnerability on this line
    }
}
```

Description: The `setData` function in the smart contract `UninitializedStoragePointer` assigns the value of an uninitialized local variable `localData` to the state variable `data`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as the uninitialized storage pointer may point to unintended storage slots.

# Remediations

- Initialize local variables before assigning them to state variables to avoid uninitialized storage pointer vulnerabilities.
- Use explicit initialization for all variables to ensure that storage pointers are properly initialized before use.
