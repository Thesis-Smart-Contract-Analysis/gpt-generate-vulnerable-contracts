However, due to a typographical error, the code incorrectly converts the sender's address to a `uint32` and checks if it equals zero. This check will not accurately verify the last 8 hex characters of the address.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Explicitly convert the sender's address to a `uint32` to extract the last 8 hex characters for comparison.\n- Use bitwise operations to extract the last 8 hex characters of the sender's address for accurate comparison."
