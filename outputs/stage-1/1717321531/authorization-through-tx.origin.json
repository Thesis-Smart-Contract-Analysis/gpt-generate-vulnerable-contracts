Using `tx.origin` for authorization can be risky as it relies on the originating address of the transaction, which can be manipulated in certain scenarios.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Use `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin` for authorization checks. `msg.sender` represents the direct caller of the function and is a more secure way to verify the sender's identity.\n- Implement a role-based access control system to manage ownership and permissions within the smart contract. This can provide a more robust and secure way to handle authorization."
