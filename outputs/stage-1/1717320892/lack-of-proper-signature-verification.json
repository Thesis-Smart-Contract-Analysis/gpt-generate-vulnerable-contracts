This check is not a secure way to verify the signature of the sender and can lead to unauthorized access.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- Explicitly define a proper signature verification mechanism using cryptographic methods like ECDSA signatures to ensure the authenticity of the sender's address.\n- Implement a secure way to verify the sender's identity, such as using a whitelist of approved addresses or implementing a multi-factor authentication system."
