# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HidingMaliciousCode {
    address public owner;

    function HidingMaliciousCode() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) {
        owner = _newOwner;
    }

    function withdraw() {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
    }

    function callMaliciousCode(address _maliciousContract) {
        _maliciousContract.callcode();
    }
}
```

The vulnerability lies in the line:
```solidity
_maliciousContract.callcode();
```

Description:
The `callMaliciousCode` function in the smart contract `HidingMaliciousCode` allows any external contract to execute its code using `callcode`. This can lead to unexpected behavior or malicious actions being performed by the external contract.

# Remediations

- Avoid using low-level functions like `callcode` that delegate execution to external contracts.
- Implement proper access control mechanisms to restrict which contracts can interact with critical functions in your smart contract.
