This can lead to unexpected behavior or malicious actions being performed by the external contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Avoid using low-level functions like `callcode` that delegate execution to external contracts.\n- Implement proper access control mechanisms to restrict which contracts can interact with critical functions in your smart contract."
