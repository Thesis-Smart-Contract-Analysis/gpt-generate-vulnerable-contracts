This allows an attacker to manipulate the state of the contract by calling functions from an untrusted contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Avoid using `delegatecall` to call functions from untrusted contracts.\n- Implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can change critical state variables."
