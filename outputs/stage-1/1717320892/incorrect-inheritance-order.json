This can lead to unexpected behavior as the constructor of `MaliciousContract` will be executed before the constructor of `IncorrectInheritanceOrder`, potentially causing issues with the initialization of state variables.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Ensure that the correct order of inheritance is maintained in the contract definitions.\n- Always verify the order of inheritance to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure proper initialization of state variables."
