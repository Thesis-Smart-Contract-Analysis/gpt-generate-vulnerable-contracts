This condition is easily manipulated by an attacker due to the predictability of the address.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1:** Use a more secure and unpredictable method to determine the winner, such as incorporating randomness from an oracle or using a secure random number generator.\n- **Remediation 2:** Implement additional checks and validations to ensure the fairness and security of the winner selection process."
