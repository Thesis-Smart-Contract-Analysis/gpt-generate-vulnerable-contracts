This condition is insufficient to prevent a griefing attack where an attacker can intentionally consume all gas to prevent others from withdrawing funds.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Increase the gas requirement to a sufficient amount to cover the gas cost of the transaction and ensure that legitimate users can still withdraw funds.\n- Implement a withdrawal pattern that uses a withdrawal pattern with a separate withdrawal function to avoid gas griefing attacks."
