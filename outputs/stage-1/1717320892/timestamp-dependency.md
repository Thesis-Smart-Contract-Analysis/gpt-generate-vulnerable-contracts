# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract TimestampDependency {

  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0); // Vulnerable line
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the above smart contract: The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawWinnings` function where the condition for determining the winner is based on the last 8 hex characters of the caller's address being 0. This condition is easily manipulated by an attacker due to the predictability of the address.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Use a more secure and unpredictable method to determine the winner, such as incorporating randomness from an oracle or using a secure random number generator.
- **Remediation 2:** Implement additional checks and validations to ensure the fairness and security of the winner selection process.
