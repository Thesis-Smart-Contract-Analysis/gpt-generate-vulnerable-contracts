# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0); // Line with Lack of Proper Signature Verification vulnerability
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

## Description

The smart contract `HashForEther` has a Lack of Proper Signature Verification vulnerability on the line where the `require` statement is used to check if the last 8 hex characters of the sender's address are 0. This check is not a secure way to verify the signature of the sender and can lead to unauthorized access.

## Remediations

- Explicitly define a proper signature verification mechanism using cryptographic methods like ECDSA signatures to ensure the authenticity of the sender's address.
- Implement a secure way to verify the sender's identity, such as using a whitelist of approved addresses or implementing a multi-factor authentication system.
