# Smart contract with Insufficient Gas Griefing Vulnerability

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract InsufficientGasGriefing {

  function withdraw() public {
    require(gasleft() > 10000); // Vulnerable line
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }

}
```

Description:
In the smart contract `InsufficientGasGriefing`, the `withdraw` function allows anyone to withdraw funds from the contract as long as the remaining gas is more than 10,000. This condition is insufficient to prevent a griefing attack where an attacker can intentionally consume all gas to prevent others from withdrawing funds.

# Remediations

- Increase the gas requirement to a sufficient amount to cover the gas cost of the transaction and ensure that legitimate users can still withdraw funds.
- Implement a withdrawal pattern that uses a withdrawal pattern with a separate withdrawal function to avoid gas griefing attacks.
