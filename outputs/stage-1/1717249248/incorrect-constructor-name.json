Here is the fixed version of the smart contract:\n\n```solidity\n// Fixed Version with Correct Constructor Name\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract CorrectConstructorName {\n    address public owner;\n\n    // Correct constructor name, same as the contract name\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy naming the constructor function the same as the contract name, you can avoid the Incorrect Constructor Name vulnerability."
