This can lead to unexpected behavior if the `call` fails but the contract continues execution assuming it was successful.\n\n### Remediation:\n\nTo mitigate the Unchecked Return Value vulnerability, you should always check the return value of the `call` function to ensure the success of the external call. Here is the remediated version of the smart contract:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract CheckedReturnValue {\n    \n    function transferFunds(address payable recipient, uint amount) public {\n        (bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: amount}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n    }\n    \n}\n```\n\nIn the remediated version, the return value of the `call` function is checked using `require(success, \"Transfer failed\")`. This ensures that the function execution will revert if the external call fails, preventing any unexpected behavior."
