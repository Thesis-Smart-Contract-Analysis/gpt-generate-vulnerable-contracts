Below is a vulnerable smart contract that has the vulnerability of hiding malicious code with an external contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MaliciousContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }

    function maliciousFunction(address _target) public {
        // Malicious code hidden here
        // This function will perform a malicious action on the target contract
        // For example, self-destructing the target contract
        selfdestruct(_target);
    }
}

contract VulnerableContract {
    address public owner;
    MaliciousContract public maliciousContract;

    constructor(address _maliciousContract) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        maliciousContract = MaliciousContract(_maliciousContract);
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }

    function callMaliciousFunction(address _target) public {
        maliciousContract.maliciousFunction(_target);
    }
}
```

In the above code, the `VulnerableContract` interacts with the `MaliciousContract` and calls the `maliciousFunction` which contains hidden malicious code that can perform harmful actions on the target contract.

### Remediation:
To remediate the vulnerability of hiding malicious code with an external contract, you can follow these steps:

1. **Audit External Contracts**: Before interacting with external contracts, thoroughly audit the code of the external contracts to ensure they do not contain any malicious code.

2. **Use Trusted Contracts**: Only interact with contracts that are trusted and have been verified to be secure.

3. **Implement Access Control**: Implement proper access control mechanisms in the external contract to restrict unauthorized access to critical functions.

4. **Use Upgradeable Contracts**: Consider using upgradeable contracts where the logic can be upgraded in case of any vulnerabilities found in the external contracts.

5. **Verify Contract Interactions**: Verify the interactions with external contracts and ensure that the functions being called are safe and do not pose any security risks.

By following these remediation steps, you can mitigate the risk of hiding malicious code with external contracts in your smart contracts.
