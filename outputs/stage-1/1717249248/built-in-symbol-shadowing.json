This can lead to unintended behavior where the assignments are made to the local variable instead of the state variable, causing the state variable to remain unchanged.\n\n### Remediation:\nTo avoid the Built-in Symbol Shadowing vulnerability, it is recommended to use a naming convention that clearly distinguishes between state variables and local variables. One common convention is to prefix state variables with an underscore or `this.` to differentiate them from local variables.\n\nHere is the remediated version of the smart contract:\n\n```solidity\n// Remediated smart contract with Fixed Built-in Symbol Shadowing vulnerability\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract SymbolShadowingFixed {\n    uint256 public value;\n\n    constructor(uint256 _value) {\n        value = _value; // Assign the parameter _value to the state variable value\n    }\n\n    function updateValue(uint256 newValue) public {\n        value = newValue; // Update the state variable value with the new value\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the remediated version, the constructor parameter is named `_value` to differentiate it from the state variable `value`. This helps to prevent symbol shadowing and ensures that the assignments are made to the correct variable."
