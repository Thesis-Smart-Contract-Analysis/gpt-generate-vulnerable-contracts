```solidity
// Incorrect Constructor Name Vulnerability Example

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IncorrectConstructorName {
    address public owner;

    // Incorrect constructor name, should be the same as the contract name
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}
```

### Remediation:
To remediate the Incorrect Constructor Name vulnerability, ensure that the constructor function has the same name as the contract itself. Here is the fixed version of the smart contract:

```solidity
// Fixed Version with Correct Constructor Name

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CorrectConstructorName {
    address public owner;

    // Correct constructor name, same as the contract name
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}
```

By naming the constructor function the same as the contract name, you can avoid the Incorrect Constructor Name vulnerability.
