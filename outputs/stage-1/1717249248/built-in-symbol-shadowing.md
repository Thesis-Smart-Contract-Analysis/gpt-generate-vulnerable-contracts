```solidity
// Smart contract with Built-in Symbol Shadowing vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SymbolShadowing {
    uint256 public value;

    constructor(uint256 value) {
        value = value; // This assignment shadows the state variable 'value'
    }

    function updateValue(uint256 newValue) public {
        value = newValue; // This assignment updates the local variable 'value' instead of the state variable
    }
}
```

### Vulnerability Description:
In the smart contract `SymbolShadowing`, the constructor and the `updateValue` function both have a local variable named `value` which shadows the state variable `value`. This can lead to unintended behavior where the assignments are made to the local variable instead of the state variable, causing the state variable to remain unchanged.

### Remediation:
To avoid the Built-in Symbol Shadowing vulnerability, it is recommended to use a naming convention that clearly distinguishes between state variables and local variables. One common convention is to prefix state variables with an underscore or `this.` to differentiate them from local variables.

Here is the remediated version of the smart contract:

```solidity
// Remediated smart contract with Fixed Built-in Symbol Shadowing vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SymbolShadowingFixed {
    uint256 public value;

    constructor(uint256 _value) {
        value = _value; // Assign the parameter _value to the state variable value
    }

    function updateValue(uint256 newValue) public {
        value = newValue; // Update the state variable value with the new value
    }
}
```

In the remediated version, the constructor parameter is named `_value` to differentiate it from the state variable `value`. This helps to prevent symbol shadowing and ensures that the assignments are made to the correct variable.
