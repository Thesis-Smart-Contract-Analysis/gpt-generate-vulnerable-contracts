However, relying solely on `block.timestamp` for time-based operations can be vulnerable to manipulation by miners.\n\nAn attacker with control over the mining process can potentially manipulate the timestamp to bypass the time lock and unlock the contract prematurely.\n\n### Remediation for Timestamp Dependency Vulnerability:\n\nTo mitigate the Timestamp Dependency vulnerability, it is recommended to use block numbers instead of timestamps for time-dependent operations. Block numbers are more secure and less susceptible to manipulation.\n\nHere is the remediated version of the smart contract `TimeLock` using block numbers:\n\n```solidity\n// Remediated Smart Contract with Block Number Dependency\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract TimeLock {\n    address public owner;\n    uint public unlockBlock;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n        unlockBlock = block.number + 10; // Unlock after 10 blocks for testing purposes\n    }\n\n    function unlock() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can unlock\");\n        require(block.number >= unlockBlock, \"The unlock block has not arrived yet\");\n\n        // Perform unlock operation\n        owner = address(0);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the remediated version, the `unlock` function now uses `block.number` to determine the unlock condition instead of `block.timestamp`. This change makes the contract less vulnerable to timestamp manipulation attacks.\n\nBy using block numbers, the smart contract becomes more secure and resistant to timestamp manipulation vulnerabilities."
