Below is a vulnerable smart contract that exhibits Stack Size Limit vulnerability:

```solidity
// Vulnerable Smart Contract with Stack Size Limit Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract StackSizeLimit {
    
    uint256 public result;
    
    function calculate(uint256 n) public {
        if (n == 0) {
            result = 0;
        } else {
            result = n + recursiveCalculate(n - 1);
        }
    }
    
    function recursiveCalculate(uint256 n) internal returns(uint256) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            return n + recursiveCalculate(n - 1);
        }
    }
}
```

In the above smart contract, the `calculate` function recursively calls the `recursiveCalculate` function until `n` becomes 0. This can lead to a Stack Size Limit vulnerability if the recursion depth becomes too large, causing the contract to run out of gas and fail.

### Remediation:

To remediate the Stack Size Limit vulnerability, you can refactor the code to avoid deep recursion. One common approach is to convert the recursive function into an iterative one. Here is an updated version of the smart contract with an iterative approach:

```solidity
// Fixed Smart Contract with Iterative Approach

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract StackSizeLimitFixed {
    
    uint256 public result;
    
    function calculate(uint256 n) public {
        result = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            result += i;
        }
    }
}
```

In the remediated version, the `calculate` function uses a loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` iteratively instead of recursively. This approach eliminates the risk of hitting the Stack Size Limit due to deep recursion.
