However, the function `updateSecretNumber` tries to update the `secretNumber`, which will result in a compilation error due to attempting to modify an immutable variable.\n\n### Remediation:\nTo fix the Immutable Bugs vulnerability, you should ensure that immutable variables are only assigned a value once during contract deployment and cannot be modified thereafter. If you need to update a value, consider using a regular state variable instead of an immutable one.\n\nHere is the remediated version of the smart contract:\n\n```solidity\n// Smart contract with Immutable Bugs vulnerability fixed\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract ImmutableBugFixed {\n    uint private immutable secretNumber;\n\n    constructor(uint _secretNumber) {\n        secretNumber = _secretNumber;\n    }\n\n    function getSecretNumber() public view returns (uint) {\n        return secretNumber;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the remediated version, the `updateSecretNumber` function has been removed, ensuring that the `secretNumber` remains immutable and cannot be modified after deployment."
