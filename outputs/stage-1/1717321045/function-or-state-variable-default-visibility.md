# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() { // Line 7
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() { // Line 12
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

The vulnerability in the smart contract `HashForEther` is that the functions `withdrawWinnings` and `_sendWinnings` have default visibility, which means they are implicitly `public`. This can lead to unintended behavior where functions meant to be internal can be called publicly by anyone.

# Remediations

- Explicitly specify the visibility of functions to ensure they are not publicly accessible. In this case, you can change the visibility of the functions as follows:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {
  
  function withdrawWinnings() public { // Explicitly set visibility to public
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0.
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() internal { // Explicitly set visibility to internal
     msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }

}
```

By explicitly setting the visibility of functions, you can prevent unintended access and enhance the security of the smart contract.
