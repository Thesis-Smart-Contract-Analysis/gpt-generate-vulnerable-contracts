# Smart contract with Insufficient Gas Griefing Vulnerability

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract InsufficientGasGriefing {

  function withdraw() public {
    require(gasleft() < 10000); // Vulnerable line
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }

}
```

In the above smart contract, the vulnerability lies in the line where `require(gasleft() < 10000)` is used. This condition allows an attacker to manipulate the gas limit to force the `require` statement to fail, resulting in a griefing attack where the `withdraw` function can be called multiple times without sufficient gas.

# Remediations

- Increase the gas requirement to a reasonable amount to prevent gas manipulation attacks.
- Implement a circuit breaker pattern to limit the number of withdrawals within a certain time frame to mitigate potential griefing attacks.
