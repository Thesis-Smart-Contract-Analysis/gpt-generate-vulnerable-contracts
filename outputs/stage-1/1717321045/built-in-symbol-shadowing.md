# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

The vulnerability is in the line `require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);` where the function `withdrawWinnings` is using the default visibility of `public` for the state variable `msg.sender`. This can lead to unintended behavior where anyone can call the `_sendWinnings` function to withdraw ETH from the smart contract without needing to have an address with the last 8 hex characters as `0`.

# Description

The default visibility of functions in Solidity is `public`. Not explicitly declaring the visibility can lead to unexpected behaviors in smart contracts. For example, functions that are meant to be used internally within the smart contract can be called publicly by anyone.

# Remediation

To fix this vulnerability, you can explicitly set the visibility of functions to `public` or `internal` based on their intended usage. In the case of the `HashForEther` contract, you can update the visibility as follows:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {
  
  function withdrawWinnings() public {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0.
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() internal {
     msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }

}
```

By explicitly setting the visibility of functions, you can prevent unintended access and enhance the security of the smart contract.
