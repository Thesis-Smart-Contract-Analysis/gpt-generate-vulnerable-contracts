# Smart contract

```solidity
contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() { // Line 7
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

The smart contract `HashForEther` has the Incorrect Constructor Name vulnerability on line 7. The function `withdrawWinnings` is mistakenly named as if it were a constructor, but it is actually a regular function.

# Remediations

- Update the function `withdrawWinnings` to have the correct function name.
- Ensure that constructor functions have the same name as the smart contract.

By fixing the function name, you can avoid confusion and potential issues related to the incorrect constructor name vulnerability.
