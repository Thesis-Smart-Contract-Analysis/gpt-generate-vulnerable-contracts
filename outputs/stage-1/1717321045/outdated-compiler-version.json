The vulnerability lies in the fact that the compiler version used is outdated, which may expose the contract to known security issues and bugs.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- Update the Solidity compiler version to the latest one to ensure that the smart contract benefits from the latest security features and bug fixes.\n- Consider reviewing and updating any deprecated functions or features used in the smart contract to align with the current best practices and standards."
