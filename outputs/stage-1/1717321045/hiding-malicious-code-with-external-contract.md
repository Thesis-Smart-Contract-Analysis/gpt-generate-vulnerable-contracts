# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HidingMaliciousCode {
  
  address public owner;
  address public externalContract;

  function HidingMaliciousCode() {
    owner = msg.sender;
    externalContract = 0x123...; // External contract address
  }

  function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) {
    require(msg.sender == owner);
    owner = _newOwner;
  }

  function callExternalContract(bytes _data) {
    require(msg.sender == owner);
    externalContract.call(_data);
  }
  
}
```

The vulnerability lies in the line `externalContract.call(_data);` where the smart contract `HidingMaliciousCode` is calling an external contract using `call` without proper validation or checks, which can lead to potential security risks.

# Remediations

- Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific and trusted external contract addresses to be called.
- Implement proper input validation and checks before calling external contracts to ensure the safety and integrity of the smart contract.
