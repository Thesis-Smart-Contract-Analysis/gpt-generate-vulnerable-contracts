This allows an attacker to manipulate the storage of the `VulnerableDelegateCall` contract by calling the `setOwner` function of a malicious contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Use `call` instead of `delegatecall` to interact with external contracts to prevent unintended storage manipulation.\n- Implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can change the owner of the contract."
