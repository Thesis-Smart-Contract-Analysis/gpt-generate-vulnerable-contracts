The function `withdrawWinnings` is mistakenly named as if it were a constructor, but it is actually a regular function.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Update the function `withdrawWinnings` to have the correct function name.\n- Ensure that constructor functions have the same name as the smart contract.\n\nBy fixing the function name, you can avoid confusion and potential issues related to the incorrect constructor name vulnerability."
