# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract TimestampDependency {
  
  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0); // Vulnerable line
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the above smart contract: The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawWinnings` function where the condition for determining the winner is based on the last 8 hex characters of the caller's address being 0. This condition is dependent on the timestamp of the transaction and can be manipulated by miners or attackers.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Instead of relying on the last 8 hex characters of the address, consider using a more secure and deterministic method for determining the winner, such as using a random number generator with a verifiable source of randomness.
  
- **Remediation 2:** Implement a secure way to select winners that is not dependent on the timestamp of the transaction to prevent timestamp manipulation attacks.
