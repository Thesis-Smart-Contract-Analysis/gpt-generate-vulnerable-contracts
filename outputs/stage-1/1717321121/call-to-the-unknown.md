# Smart contract with Call to the Unknown vulnerability

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    address public owner;

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        owner = _newOwner;
        _unknownFunction();
    }

    function _unknownFunction() private {
        // Some unknown logic here
    }
}
```

Description: The `_unknownFunction` is a private function that is called within the `transferOwnership` function. However, the `_unknownFunction` is not defined or implemented anywhere in the smart contract, leading to a Call to the Unknown vulnerability.

# Remediations

- Define and implement the `_unknownFunction` with the necessary logic to avoid the Call to the Unknown vulnerability.
- Ensure that all functions called within the smart contract are properly defined and implemented to prevent unexpected behavior.
