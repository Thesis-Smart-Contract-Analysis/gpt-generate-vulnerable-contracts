Contract `B` is inheriting from contract `A`, but contract `A` is defined inside contract `B`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- Define contract `A` outside of contract `B` to ensure proper inheritance order.\n- Ensure that the inheritance hierarchy is clearly defined and follows the correct order to avoid any ambiguity or vulnerabilities."
