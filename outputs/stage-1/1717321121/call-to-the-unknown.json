However, the `_unknownFunction` is not defined or implemented anywhere in the smart contract, leading to a Call to the Unknown vulnerability.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Define and implement the `_unknownFunction` with the necessary logic to avoid the Call to the Unknown vulnerability.\n- Ensure that all functions called within the smart contract are properly defined and implemented to prevent unexpected behavior."
