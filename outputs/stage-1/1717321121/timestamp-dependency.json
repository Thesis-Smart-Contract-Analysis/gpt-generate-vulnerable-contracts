This condition is dependent on the timestamp of the transaction and can be manipulated by miners or attackers.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1:** Instead of relying on the last 8 hex characters of the address, consider using a more secure and deterministic method for determining the winner, such as using a random number generator with a verifiable source of randomness.\n  \n- **Remediation 2:** Implement a secure way to select winners that is not dependent on the timestamp of the transaction to prevent timestamp manipulation attacks."
