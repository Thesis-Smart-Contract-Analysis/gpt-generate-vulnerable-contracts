# Smart contract with Frozen Ether Vulnerability

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract FrozenEther {
    
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0);
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }

    function getBalance() public view returns (uint) {
        return balances[msg.sender];
    }
}
```

In the above smart contract, the vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function at line where `msg.sender.transfer(amount);`. This line allows anyone to withdraw the Ether balance associated with their address without any restrictions or checks.

# Description

The `withdraw` function in the smart contract allows any user to withdraw their Ether balance without any additional conditions or restrictions. This can lead to a scenario where an attacker can continuously withdraw Ether from the contract, draining it of funds.

# Remediations

- Implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can withdraw funds from the contract.
- Use the Withdrawal Pattern where users need to explicitly request a withdrawal, and the contract holds the funds until the request is processed.
- Consider implementing a time delay or multi-signature requirement for withdrawals to add an extra layer of security.
