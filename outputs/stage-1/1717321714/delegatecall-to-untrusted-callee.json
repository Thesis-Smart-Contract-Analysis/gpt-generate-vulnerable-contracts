This allows the untrusted callee to modify the state variables of the `VulnerableDelegateCall` contract, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in ownership.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1**: Avoid using `delegatecall` to call functions of untrusted addresses. Ensure that only trusted contracts are allowed to modify critical state variables.\n- **Remediation 2**: Implement access control mechanisms to restrict which addresses can call functions that modify sensitive state variables.\n- **Remediation 3**: Use a whitelist approach to validate the addresses that can be called using `delegatecall` to prevent unauthorized modifications."
