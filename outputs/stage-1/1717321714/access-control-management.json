This can lead to unauthorized ownership changes and potential security risks.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Implement access control checks in the `changeOwner` function to restrict ownership changes to authorized addresses only.\n- Use modifiers like `onlyOwner` to ensure that only the designated owner can change the ownership of the contract."
