If the function `unknownFunction` does not exist in the contract at the address `_target`, the call will still be successful, leading to unexpected behavior.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Use a whitelist approach to ensure that the target address is a trusted contract with known functions.\n- Implement a mechanism to verify the function signature before making the call to prevent calling unknown functions."
