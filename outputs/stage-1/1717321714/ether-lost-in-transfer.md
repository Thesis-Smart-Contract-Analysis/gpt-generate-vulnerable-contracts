# Smart contract with Ether Lost in Transfer Vulnerability

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract EtherLostInTransfer {
    
    function transferEther(address _recipient) public {
        _recipient.transfer(this.balance); // Vulnerable line
    }
    
}
```

In the above smart contract, the vulnerability lies in the line where the `transfer` function is used to send the entire balance of the contract to the `_recipient` address without any check or condition.

# Description

The vulnerability in the smart contract `EtherLostInTransfer` allows anyone to call the `transferEther` function and drain all the Ether stored in the contract to the specified recipient address without any restrictions or validations.

# Remediations

- Implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can call the `transferEther` function.
- Use a withdrawal pattern where users need to withdraw their funds instead of allowing direct transfers.
- Consider using a withdrawal limit or implementing a multisig wallet for more secure fund management.
