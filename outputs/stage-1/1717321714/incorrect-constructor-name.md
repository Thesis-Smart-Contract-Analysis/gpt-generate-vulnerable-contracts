# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() { // Line 7
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

The smart contract `HashForEther` has the Incorrect Constructor Name vulnerability on line 7 where the constructor function is named `withdrawWinnings` instead of `HashForEther`.

# Description

The Incorrect Constructor Name vulnerability occurs when the constructor function in a smart contract is named differently than the contract name. This can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior as the constructor function should have the same name as the contract.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Rename the function `withdrawWinnings` to `HashForEther` to match the contract name.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function HashForEther() public {
    // Constructor logic here
  }

  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() internal {
     msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }

}
```

By renaming the function to match the contract name, the Incorrect Constructor Name vulnerability is mitigated.

Remember to always ensure consistency in naming conventions to avoid confusion and potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
