Using `tx.origin` for authorization can lead to a security vulnerability as it relies on the initial sender of the transaction, which can be manipulated in certain scenarios.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Instead of using `tx.origin`, it is recommended to use `msg.sender` for authorization checks. `msg.sender` represents the direct caller of the function and is a more secure way to verify the sender's identity.\n- Implement access control mechanisms such as modifiers or access control lists to manage authorization in a more secure and controlled manner."
