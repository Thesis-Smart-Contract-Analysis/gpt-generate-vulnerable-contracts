This allows anyone to call the `_sendWinnings` function without meeting the actual winning condition.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Explicitly define the visibility of functions to prevent unintended access. For example, change `function withdrawWinnings()` to `function withdrawWinnings() public`.\n- Use a more secure and reliable method to determine the winner, such as using cryptographic randomness or external oracles for fairness.\n```"
