# Smart contract with Ether Lost in Transfer Vulnerability

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract EtherLostInTransfer {
  
  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

Description: In the `_sendWinnings` function, the `transfer` function is used to send Ether to the `msg.sender` without proper validation. This can lead to Ether being lost if the transfer fails due to out-of-gas or other issues.

# Remediations

- Update the visibility of the `_sendWinnings` function to `internal` to restrict external access and prevent unintended transfers.
- Implement proper error handling mechanisms in the `_sendWinnings` function to handle potential transfer failures gracefully.
