```solidity
// Smart contract with Short Address Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ShortAddressVulnerability {
    
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
    
}
```

In the smart contract above, the `transferOwnership` function allows the owner to transfer ownership to a new address. However, it is vulnerable to the Short Address Attack. In this vulnerability, an attacker can send a transaction with a short address (less than 20 bytes) to the `transferOwnership` function, causing the comparison `msg.sender == owner` to fail and allowing the attacker to take over ownership.

### Remediation:

To prevent the Short Address Vulnerability, you can use the following remediation techniques:

1. **Use `address` type for input validation**: Ensure that the input address is of the correct length by explicitly checking the length of the address before proceeding with any comparisons or operations.

2. **Use `require` statement for address length validation**: Add a `require` statement to validate the length of the input address before proceeding with any critical operations. This will prevent short address attacks.

Here is an updated version of the smart contract with the remediation applied:

```solidity
// Smart contract with Remediation for Short Address Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ShortAddressVulnerabilityFixed {
    
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        require(_newOwner.length == 20, "Invalid address length");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
    
}
```

By adding the `require(_newOwner.length == 20, "Invalid address length")` statement, we ensure that the input address has the correct length before proceeding with the ownership transfer. This helps mitigate the Short Address Vulnerability.
