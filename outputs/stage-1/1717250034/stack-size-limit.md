```solidity
// Smart contract with Stack Size Limit vulnerability
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract StackSizeLimit {
    
    uint256 public result;
    
    function calculate(uint256 input) public {
        result = recursiveFunction(input);
    }
    
    function recursiveFunction(uint256 input) private returns(uint256) {
        if(input == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        return input + recursiveFunction(input - 1);
    }
}
```

In the smart contract above, the `recursiveFunction` is a recursive function that adds numbers from `input` down to 0. If the input value is too large, it can cause a stack overflow due to the limited stack size in Ethereum. This vulnerability can lead to the contract failing to execute and potentially losing gas fees.

## Remediation:

To remediate the Stack Size Limit vulnerability, you can refactor the recursive function to an iterative function. By converting the recursive function to an iterative one, you can avoid the risk of running out of stack space.

Here is the remediated version of the smart contract:

```solidity
// Smart contract with remediated Stack Size Limit vulnerability
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract StackSizeLimitFixed {
    
    uint256 public result;
    
    function calculate(uint256 input) public {
        result = iterativeFunction(input);
    }
    
    function iterativeFunction(uint256 input) private returns(uint256) {
        uint256 sum = 0;
        for(uint256 i = 1; i <= input; i++) {
            sum += i;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

In the remediated version, the `iterativeFunction` calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `input` iteratively instead of recursively, eliminating the risk of stack overflow.
