This can lead to unintended behavior and potential vulnerabilities in the contract.\n\nTo remediate the Typographical Error vulnerability, you should correct the function name to `deposit` to ensure that the function is correctly called and executed as intended. Here is the remediated version of the smart contract:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract TypoFixed {\n    uint public balance;\n\n    function deposit(uint _amount) public {\n        balance += _amount;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy fixing the typographical error in the function name, you can prevent potential issues and ensure that the smart contract functions as expected."
