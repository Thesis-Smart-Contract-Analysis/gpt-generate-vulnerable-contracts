        "content": "Below is a vulnerable smart contract with Double Constructor vulnerability:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract DoubleConstructorVulnerability {\n    address public owner;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    constructor(address _newOwner) {\n        owner = _newOwner;\n    }\n\n    function getOwner() public view returns (address) {\n        return owner;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above smart contract, there are two constructors defined. This is not allowed in Solidity and can lead to unexpected behavior. The last defined constructor will override the previous one, and the contract will use the last constructor defined during deployment.\n\n### Remediation:\nTo remediate the Double Constructor vulnerability, you should only have one constructor in your smart contract. If you need to have different initialization logic based on different parameters, you can achieve this by using function overloading or conditional logic within a single constructor.\n\nHere is the remediated version of the smart contract:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract SingleConstructorFixed {\n    address public owner;\n\n    constructor(address _newOwner) {\n        owner = _newOwner;\n    }\n\n    function getOwner() public view returns (address) {\n        return owner;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the remediated version, we have removed the extra constructor and combined the functionality into a single constructor that takes an address parameter to set the owner. This ensures that there is only one constructor in the smart contract, eliminating the Double Constructor vulnerability."
