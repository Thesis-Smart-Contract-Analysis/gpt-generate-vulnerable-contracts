However, it lacks proper validation of the recovered signer address. This can lead to a vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate the signature parameters to impersonate a different address and gain unauthorized access.\n\n### Remediation:\nTo address the Lack of Proper Signature Verification vulnerability, you should implement additional checks to ensure that the recovered signer address matches the expected address. One common approach is to compare the recovered signer address with the expected signer address before proceeding with any sensitive operations.\n\nHere is an updated version of the `verifySignature` function with proper signature verification:\n\n```solidity\nfunction verifySignature(bytes32 message, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public view returns (address) {\n    address expectedSigner = owner; // Set the expected signer address\n    address signer = ecrecover(message, v, r, s);\n    \n    require(signer == expectedSigner, \"Signature verification failed\");\n    \n    return signer;\n}\n```\n\nIn the remediated version, we compare the `signer` address with the `expectedSigner` address and only proceed if they match. This ensures that the signature is verified against the expected signer address, preventing unauthorized access."
