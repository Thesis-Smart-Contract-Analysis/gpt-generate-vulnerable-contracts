However, using `block.timestamp` for generating random numbers is not secure as it can be manipulated by miners to some extent.\n\n## Remediation\n\nTo address the Weak Sources of Randomness from Chain Attributes vulnerability, it is recommended to use more secure sources of randomness such as Oracles, Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function), or external randomness providers. These solutions provide a more secure and tamper-proof way of generating random numbers in smart contracts.\n\nHere is an example of how you can integrate Chainlink VRF into the smart contract to improve randomness:\n\n```solidity\n// Smart contract with improved randomness using Chainlink VRF\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nimport \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBase.sol\";\n\ncontract RandomnessWithChainlink is VRFConsumerBase {\n    bytes32 internal keyHash;\n    uint256 internal fee;\n    uint256 public randomNumber;\n\n    constructor(address _vrfCoordinator, address _link, bytes32 _keyHash, uint256 _fee) \n        VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator, _link)\n    {\n        keyHash = _keyHash;\n        fee = _fee;\n    }\n\n    function getRandomNumber() public {\n        require(LINK.balanceOf(address(this)) >= fee, \"Not enough LINK tokens\");\n        requestRandomness(keyHash, fee);\n    }\n\n    function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness) internal override {\n        randomNumber = randomness % 100;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this improved version, we are using Chainlink VRF to generate a secure and verifiable random number. The `fulfillRandomness` function is called when the random number is generated by Chainlink VRF, and the `randomNumber` is set based on the generated randomness. This approach ensures a more secure and reliable source of randomness in the smart contract."
