```solidity
// Smart contract with Weak Sources of Randomness from Chain Attributes vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract WeakRandomness {
    uint256 public randomNumber;

    constructor() {
        // Using block.timestamp as a source of randomness
        randomNumber = uint256(block.timestamp) % 100;
    }

    function getRandomNumber() public view returns (uint256) {
        return randomNumber;
    }
}
```

In the above smart contract, the `randomNumber` is generated using `block.timestamp` as a source of randomness. However, using `block.timestamp` for generating random numbers is not secure as it can be manipulated by miners to some extent.

## Remediation

To address the Weak Sources of Randomness from Chain Attributes vulnerability, it is recommended to use more secure sources of randomness such as Oracles, Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function), or external randomness providers. These solutions provide a more secure and tamper-proof way of generating random numbers in smart contracts.

Here is an example of how you can integrate Chainlink VRF into the smart contract to improve randomness:

```solidity
// Smart contract with improved randomness using Chainlink VRF

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBase.sol";

contract RandomnessWithChainlink is VRFConsumerBase {
    bytes32 internal keyHash;
    uint256 internal fee;
    uint256 public randomNumber;

    constructor(address _vrfCoordinator, address _link, bytes32 _keyHash, uint256 _fee) 
        VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator, _link)
    {
        keyHash = _keyHash;
        fee = _fee;
    }

    function getRandomNumber() public {
        require(LINK.balanceOf(address(this)) >= fee, "Not enough LINK tokens");
        requestRandomness(keyHash, fee);
    }

    function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness) internal override {
        randomNumber = randomness % 100;
    }
}
```

In this improved version, we are using Chainlink VRF to generate a secure and verifiable random number. The `fulfillRandomness` function is called when the random number is generated by Chainlink VRF, and the `randomNumber` is set based on the generated randomness. This approach ensures a more secure and reliable source of randomness in the smart contract.
