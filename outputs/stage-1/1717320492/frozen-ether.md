# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract FrozenEther {
  
  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawWinnings` function where the condition `require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);` allows anyone to call the `_sendWinnings` function and withdraw Ether without meeting the intended condition.

# Remediations

- Explicitly define the visibility of functions to prevent unintended access.
- Use explicit visibility for functions to avoid unintended external calls.

By making these changes, you can enhance the security of the smart contract and prevent unauthorized withdrawals of Ether.
