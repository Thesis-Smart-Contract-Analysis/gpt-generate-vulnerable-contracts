This can lead to unexpected behavior if the delegatecall fails but the contract continues execution.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Use `success` variable to check the return value of the `delegatecall` and handle any failure appropriately.\n- Implement proper error handling mechanisms to revert the transaction if the `delegatecall` fails."
