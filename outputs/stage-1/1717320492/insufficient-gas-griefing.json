However, this check is insufficient as an attacker can still perform a griefing attack by sending a transaction with very low gas, causing the `require` statement to fail and reverting the transaction, but still consuming some gas.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- Increase the gas requirement to a sufficient amount that covers the gas cost of the transfer and any additional operations to prevent griefing attacks.\n- Implement a gas stipend mechanism to limit the amount of gas available for the attacker to prevent gas griefing attacks."
