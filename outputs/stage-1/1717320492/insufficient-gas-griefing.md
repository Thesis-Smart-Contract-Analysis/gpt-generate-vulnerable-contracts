# Smart contract with Insufficient Gas Griefing Vulnerability

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract InsufficientGasGriefing {

  function withdraw() public {
    require(gasleft() > 10000); // Vulnerable line
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }

}
```

## Description

In the smart contract `InsufficientGasGriefing` above, the vulnerability lies in the `withdraw` function where the `require` statement checks if there is enough gas left to execute the transfer. However, this check is insufficient as an attacker can still perform a griefing attack by sending a transaction with very low gas, causing the `require` statement to fail and reverting the transaction, but still consuming some gas.

## Remediations

- Increase the gas requirement to a sufficient amount that covers the gas cost of the transfer and any additional operations to prevent griefing attacks.
- Implement a gas stipend mechanism to limit the amount of gas available for the attacker to prevent gas griefing attacks.
