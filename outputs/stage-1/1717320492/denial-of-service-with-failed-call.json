This line is vulnerable to a Denial of Service with Failed Call attack because it allows anyone to call the function and potentially cause the contract to get stuck in a loop, consuming all available gas.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Use the `transfer` function instead of `call` to send funds to the caller. This will prevent the contract from getting stuck in a loop and failing the call.\n- Implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can call the `withdrawFunds` function, ensuring that only authorized users can withdraw funds."
