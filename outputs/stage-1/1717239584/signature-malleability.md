```solidity
// Smart contract with Signature Malleability vulnerability
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SignatureMalleability {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function changeOwner(address _newOwner, bytes memory _signature) public {
        bytes32 message = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_newOwner));
        address signer = recoverSigner(message, _signature);
        
        require(signer == owner, "Signature verification failed");
        
        owner = _newOwner;
    }

    function recoverSigner(bytes32 _message, bytes memory _signature) internal pure returns (address) {
        bytes32 r;
        bytes32 s;
        uint8 v;

        assembly {
            r := mload(add(_signature, 32))
            s := mload(add(_signature, 64))
            v := byte(0, mload(add(_signature, 96)))
        }

        if (v < 27) {
            v += 27;
        }

        return ecrecover(_message, v, r, s);
    }
}
```

In the above smart contract, the `changeOwner` function allows the owner to change the owner of the contract by providing a new owner address and a signature. The signature is verified using the `ecrecover` function. However, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the `v` value in the signature can be manipulated to create a different valid signature for the same message, leading to signature malleability.

### Remediation:
To mitigate the Signature Malleability vulnerability, you can use the `eth_sign` method instead of `ecrecover` to recover the signer address. The `eth_sign` method signs the hash of a message with the sender's private key, which prevents signature malleability.

Here is an updated version of the smart contract with the remediation:

```solidity
// Smart contract with remediation for Signature Malleability vulnerability
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SignatureMalleabilityFixed {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function changeOwner(address _newOwner, bytes memory _signature) public {
        bytes32 message = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_newOwner));
        address signer = ecrecover(message, uint8(_signature[64]), bytes32(_signature[0:32]), bytes32(_signature[32:64]));
        
        require(signer == owner, "Signature verification failed");
        
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
}
```

In the remediated version, the `ecrecover` function is used with the correct parameters to recover the signer address from the signature, making it resistant to signature malleability attacks.
