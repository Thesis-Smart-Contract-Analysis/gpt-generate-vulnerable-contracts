However, there is a vulnerability in the signature verification process that can lead to a Signature Replay Attack.\n\n## Vulnerability Description\n\nA Signature Replay Attack occurs when an attacker captures a valid signature from a legitimate transaction and then replays that signature to perform unauthorized transactions. In this case, the attacker can intercept a valid signature from a legitimate transfer transaction initiated by the owner and then use that same signature to replay the transaction multiple times.\n\n## Remediation\n\nTo prevent Signature Replay Attacks, it is important to include a nonce or a unique identifier in the signed message to ensure that each signature can only be used once. By adding a nonce to the message that is signed by the owner, the signature becomes specific to that particular transaction and cannot be reused.\n\nHere is an updated version of the `TransferFunds` contract with nonce implementation:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract TransferFunds {\n    address public owner;\n    mapping(address => uint) public nonces;\n    \n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n    \n    function transfer(address payable recipient, uint amount, uint nonce, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can initiate transfers\");\n        \n        require(nonces[msg.sender] == nonce, \"Invalid nonce\");\n        \n        bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(recipient, amount, nonce));\n        address signer = ecrecover(hash, v, r, s);\n        \n        require(signer == owner, \"Invalid signature\");\n        \n        recipient.transfer(amount);\n        \n        nonces[msg.sender]++;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the updated contract, a `nonce` is included in the message that is signed by the owner. The `nonce` is incremented after each successful transfer to ensure that each signature is unique and cannot be replayed. This helps prevent Signature Replay Attacks by making each signature specific to a single transaction."
