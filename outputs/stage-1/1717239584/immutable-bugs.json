However, the function `updateSecretNumber` is attempting to modify the `immutable` variable, which will result in a compilation error.\n\n## Remediation:\n\nTo fix the Immutable Bugs vulnerability, you should ensure that `immutable` variables are only assigned a value once during contract deployment and cannot be modified thereafter. If you need to update the value of a variable, consider using a regular state variable instead of an `immutable` variable.\n\nHere is the remediated version of the smart contract:\n\n```solidity\n// Smart contract with Immutable Bugs vulnerability remediated\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract ImmutableBugFixed {\n    uint256 private secretNumber;\n\n    constructor(uint256 _secretNumber) {\n        secretNumber = _secretNumber;\n    }\n\n    function getSecretNumber() public view returns (uint256) {\n        return secretNumber;\n    }\n\n    function updateSecretNumber(uint256 _newSecretNumber) public {\n        secretNumber = _newSecretNumber; // This is allowed for regular state variables\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the remediated version `ImmutableBugFixed`, the `secretNumber` variable is a regular state variable that can be updated using the `updateSecretNumber` function. This ensures that the contract does not attempt to modify an `immutable` variable, eliminating the Immutable Bugs vulnerability."
