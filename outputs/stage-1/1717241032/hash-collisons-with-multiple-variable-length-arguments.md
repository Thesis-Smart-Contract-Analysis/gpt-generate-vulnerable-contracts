Below is a vulnerable smart contract that has Hash Collisions with Multiple Variable Length Arguments vulnerability:

```solidity
// Vulnerable Smart Contract with Hash Collisions Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HashCollision {
    
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public balances;
    
    function deposit(bytes32[] memory data) public {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            balances[data[i]] += 1;
        }
    }
    
    function getBalance(bytes32 key) public view returns (uint256) {
        return balances[key];
    }
}
```

In the above smart contract, the `deposit` function allows users to deposit multiple `bytes32` values into the `balances` mapping. However, due to the use of `bytes32` as keys in the mapping, there is a vulnerability where an attacker can intentionally create hash collisions by providing multiple inputs that hash to the same value. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential denial of service attacks.

### Remediation:

To mitigate the Hash Collisions with Multiple Variable Length Arguments vulnerability, you can use a different approach to handle the mapping keys. One common approach is to use a hash function that is resistant to collisions, such as `keccak256`, and concatenate the inputs to create a unique key.

Here is an updated version of the smart contract with a remediation:

```solidity
// Secure Smart Contract with Remediation for Hash Collisions Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SecureHashCollision {
    
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public balances;
    
    function deposit(bytes32[] memory data) public {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            bytes32 key = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(data[i], i)); // Concatenate data with index to create unique key
            balances[key] += 1;
        }
    }
    
    function getBalance(bytes32 key) public view returns (uint256) {
        return balances[key];
    }
}
```

In the remediated version, the `deposit` function now concatenates each `bytes32` value with an index before hashing it using `keccak256`. This ensures that each key is unique and reduces the risk of hash collisions.
