The `attack` function is used to exploit the vulnerability by calling the `withdraw` function recursively during the fallback function.\n\n### Remediation for Re-entrancy Vulnerability:\n\nTo prevent Re-entrancy vulnerability, you can follow these remediation steps:\n\n1. **Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: Ensure that all state changes are made before interacting with external contracts. This pattern helps in preventing re-entrancy attacks.\n\n2. **Implement a Withdrawal Pattern**: Separate the state changes from the transfer of funds. Update the user's balance first and then transfer the funds to the user.\n\n3. **Use the `nonReentrant` Modifier**: Implement a `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent a function from being called recursively.\n\nHere is an updated version of the smart contract with the remediation applied:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract SecureContract {\n    mapping(address => uint) public balances;\n    mapping(address => bool) private _locked;\n\n    modifier nonReentrant() {\n        require(!_locked[msg.sender], \"Re-entrancy attack detected\");\n        _locked[msg.sender] = true;\n        _;\n        _locked[msg.sender] = false;\n    }\n\n    function deposit() public payable {\n        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;\n    }\n\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public nonReentrant {\n        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n        \n        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;\n        (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the updated version, the `nonReentrant` modifier is used to prevent re-entrancy attacks by locking the function during execution. This ensures that the function cannot be called recursively by the same address."
