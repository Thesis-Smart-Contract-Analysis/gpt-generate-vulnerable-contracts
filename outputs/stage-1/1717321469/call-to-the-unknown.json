This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Use a known interface or function signature when using the `call` function to prevent calling unknown functions.\n- Implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can call sensitive functions."
