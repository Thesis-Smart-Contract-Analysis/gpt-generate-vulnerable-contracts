# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

## Description

The smart contract `HashForEther` has an Outdated Compiler Version vulnerability. The issue lies in the pragma statement specifying the Solidity compiler version as `^0.4.24`, which indicates that the contract was written for a compiler version older than the current one. This can lead to potential security risks and compatibility issues due to changes in compiler behavior and optimizations over time.

## Remediations

- Update the pragma statement to use the latest Solidity compiler version to ensure compatibility and leverage the latest security features and optimizations.
- Consider reviewing and updating any other outdated code patterns or functions that may be impacted by changes in compiler versions.
