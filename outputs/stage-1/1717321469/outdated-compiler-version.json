The issue lies in the pragma statement specifying the Solidity compiler version as `^0.4.24`, which indicates that the contract was written for a compiler version older than the current one. This can lead to potential security risks and compatibility issues due to changes in compiler behavior and optimizations over time.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- Update the pragma statement to use the latest Solidity compiler version to ensure compatibility and leverage the latest security features and optimizations.\n- Consider reviewing and updating any other outdated code patterns or functions that may be impacted by changes in compiler versions."
