This can lead to a Transaction Ordering Dependency vulnerability where an attacker can exploit the order of transactions to withdraw more funds than they should.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Update the order of operations in the `withdraw` function to first reduce the balance and then transfer the funds to the `msg.sender`.\n- Implement a check to ensure that the balance is sufficient before transferring funds to prevent overwithdrawal vulnerabilities."
