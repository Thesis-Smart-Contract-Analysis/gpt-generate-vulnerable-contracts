# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawWinnings` function where the requirement for the last 8 hex characters of the sender's address to be 0 is not sufficient protection against signature replay attacks.

# Remediations

- Explicitly define the visibility of functions to prevent unintended access. For example, change `function withdrawWinnings()` to `function withdrawWinnings() public`.
- Implement a more robust authentication mechanism to prevent signature replay attacks, such as using cryptographic signatures or nonce-based verification.
