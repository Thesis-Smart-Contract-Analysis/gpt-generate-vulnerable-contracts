The `owner` can change by calling the `setOwner` function, but the `withdraw` function does not restrict the withdrawal to only the current `owner`. This allows anyone to call the `withdraw` function and withdraw all the Ether stored in the contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Add a modifier to the `withdraw` function to ensure only the current `owner` can withdraw funds.\n- Implement access control mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access to critical functions.\n- Consider using a withdrawal pattern where users need to request a withdrawal and the owner approves it before transferring funds."
