Here is a smart contract that demonstrates the Shadowing State Variables vulnerability:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ShadowingVariables {
    uint256 public value = 10;

    function updateValue(uint256 value) public {
        value = value; // This line shadows the state variable 'value'
    }

    function getValue() public view returns (uint256) {
        return value;
    }
}
```

In the `updateValue` function, the parameter `value` has the same name as the state variable `value`. This can lead to confusion and unintended behavior as the assignment `value = value` actually assigns the parameter value to itself, not the state variable.

### Remediation:
To remediate the Shadowing State Variables vulnerability, you can use a naming convention to differentiate between state variables and function parameters. For example, you can prefix state variables with an underscore `_` or use `this` keyword to refer to state variables explicitly.

Here is the remediated version of the smart contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract FixedShadowingVariables {
    uint256 public value = 10;

    function updateValue(uint256 _newValue) public {
        value = _newValue; // Use a different name for the parameter
    }

    function getValue() public view returns (uint256) {
        return value;
    }
}
```

In the remediated version, the parameter in the `updateValue` function is renamed to `_newValue` to differentiate it from the state variable `value`. This helps to avoid shadowing and makes the code clearer and less error-prone.
