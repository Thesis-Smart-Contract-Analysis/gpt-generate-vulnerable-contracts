Below is a vulnerable smart contract that has the Hiding Malicious Code with External Contract vulnerability:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MaliciousContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }

    function maliciousFunction(address _target) public {
        // Malicious code hidden in this function
        // This function will perform a malicious action on the target contract
        // For demonstration purposes, let's assume the malicious action is to self-destruct the target contract
        selfdestruct(_target);
    }
}

contract ExternalContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function doSomething() public {
        // Some legitimate functionality
    }
}
```

In the above smart contract, the `MaliciousContract` contains a hidden malicious function `maliciousFunction` that performs a destructive action on an external contract. The `maliciousFunction` is designed to self-destruct the target contract, which is a severe security threat.

### Remediation:
To mitigate the Hiding Malicious Code with External Contract vulnerability, you should follow these best practices:

1. **Avoid External Calls to Untrusted Contracts**: Do not call external contracts that are not trusted or verified. Always ensure that the contracts you interact with are secure and audited.

2. **Implement Access Control**: Implement proper access control mechanisms to restrict who can call critical functions in your smart contract. This will prevent unauthorized users from invoking dangerous functions.

3. **Use External Contract Whitelisting**: Maintain a whitelist of trusted external contracts that your smart contract can interact with. Only allow interactions with contracts on the whitelist to reduce the risk of malicious actions.

4. **Code Review and Security Audits**: Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits to identify and eliminate any hidden malicious code in your smart contract. External audits by security experts can help identify vulnerabilities early.

By following these remediation steps, you can enhance the security of your smart contract and prevent the exploitation of the Hiding Malicious Code with External Contract vulnerability.
