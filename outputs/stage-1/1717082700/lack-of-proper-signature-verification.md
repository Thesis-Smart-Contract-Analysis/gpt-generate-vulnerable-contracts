```solidity
// Vulnerable Smart Contract with Lack of Proper Signature Verification

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SignatureVerification {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = newOwner;
    }

    function verifySignature(bytes32 message, bytes memory signature) public view returns (address) {
        address signer = ECDSA.recover(message, signature);
        return signer;
    }
}
```

In the vulnerable smart contract `SignatureVerification`, the function `verifySignature` allows anyone to verify a signature without proper verification of the signer's identity. This can lead to unauthorized access or actions being performed by malicious users.

### Remediation:
To address the Lack of Proper Signature Verification vulnerability, you should implement a proper signature verification process using the following steps:

1. Use a whitelist of authorized signers: Maintain a list of authorized signers or public keys that are allowed to perform specific actions in the smart contract.

2. Implement a multi-step verification process: Verify the signature against the expected signer's address and compare it with the whitelist of authorized signers.

3. Use secure signature verification libraries: Utilize secure libraries like OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library for signature verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the signer.

Here is an example of how you can remediate the vulnerability in the smart contract:

```solidity
// Remediated Smart Contract with Proper Signature Verification

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol";

contract SignatureVerification {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => bool) public authorizedSigners;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        authorizedSigners[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can call this function");
        _;
    }

    function addAuthorizedSigner(address signer) public onlyOwner {
        authorizedSigners[signer] = true;
    }

    function removeAuthorizedSigner(address signer) public onlyOwner {
        authorizedSigners[signer] = false;
    }

    function verifySignature(bytes32 message, bytes memory signature) public view returns (address) {
        address signer = ECDSA.recover(message, signature);
        require(authorizedSigners[signer], "Signer is not authorized");
        return signer;
    }
}
```

In the remediated smart contract `SignatureVerification`, we have added a whitelist of authorized signers and modified the `verifySignature` function to verify the signature against the authorized signers list. Additionally, we have implemented a modifier `onlyOwner` to restrict certain functions to be called only by the owner.
