# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract SignatureMalleability {
    
    function verifySignature(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public pure returns (address) {
        address signer = ecrecover(hash, v, r, s);
        return signer;
    }
    
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the above smart contract:
The vulnerability in the `SignatureMalleability` contract lies in the `verifySignature` function. The function uses the `ecrecover` function to recover the address of the signer based on the provided signature parameters (`v`, `r`, `s`). However, the `ecrecover` function in Solidity is susceptible to signature malleability, which means that multiple different signatures can produce the same recovered address. This can lead to potential security risks and unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

# Remediations

- To mitigate the Signature Malleability vulnerability, it is recommended to use a standard signature scheme like EIP-712 (Typed Structured Data) or EIP-191 (Personal Sign). These schemes provide a standardized way to sign messages and verify signatures, reducing the risk of malleability.
- Implement additional checks or validation mechanisms in the smart contract to ensure the uniqueness and integrity of signatures, such as including a nonce or timestamp in the signed message.

By addressing the Signature Malleability vulnerability and implementing secure signature verification methods, the smart contract can enhance its security and reduce the risk of unauthorized actions based on manipulated signatures.
