Short addresses can be padded with zeros, and this can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing addresses.\n\n# Description\n\nShort Address Vulnerability occurs when comparing an address with a short address that is not properly padded with zeros. This can lead to security risks as the comparison may not work as intended.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Explicitly pad the address with zeros to ensure it has the correct length before comparison.\n- Use libraries like OpenZeppelin's Address library to handle address-related operations securely."
