However, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the `withdraw` function performs the ETH transfer before updating the user's balance. This allows a malicious contract to call the `withdraw` function recursively before the balance is updated, resulting in a re-entrancy attack.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- Implement the Check-Effect-Interaction pattern where you first check conditions, then update state variables, and finally interact with external contracts.\n- Use the Withdrawal Pattern where users need to withdraw their funds instead of automatically transferring funds in the same function.\n- Consider using the OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard library to protect against re-entrancy attacks."
