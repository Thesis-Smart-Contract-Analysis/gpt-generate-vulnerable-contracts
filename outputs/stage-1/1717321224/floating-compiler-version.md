# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract FloatingCompilerVersion {
  
  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

## Description

The vulnerability in the smart contract `FloatingCompilerVersion` lies in the fact that it uses a floating compiler version pragma statement. This can lead to inconsistencies in the behavior of the smart contract when compiled with different compiler versions.

## Remediations

- Specify a fixed compiler version in the pragma statement to ensure consistent compilation results across different versions. For example, you can use `pragma solidity ^0.4.24;` to fix the compiler version to 0.4.24.
- Regularly update the compiler version to the latest stable release to benefit from security enhancements and bug fixes provided by the Solidity team.
