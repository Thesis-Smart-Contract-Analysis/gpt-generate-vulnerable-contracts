# Smart contract with Ether Lost in Transfer Vulnerability

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract EtherLostInTransfer {
    
    function transferEther(address _recipient) public {
        _recipient.transfer(this.balance); // Vulnerable line
    }
    
}
```

Description: The vulnerability in the smart contract `EtherLostInTransfer` lies in the `transferEther` function where the contract transfers all its balance to the specified recipient address without any conditions or checks.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Implement a withdrawal pattern where the recipient needs to explicitly withdraw the Ether instead of the contract transferring it automatically.
- **Remediation 2:** Use a withdrawal pattern with a withdrawal limit and proper access control to prevent unauthorized withdrawals.
- **Remediation 3:** Consider using a more secure transfer method like `send` or `call` with proper error handling and checks.

Remember to always implement proper access controls and checks when handling Ether transfers in smart contracts to prevent vulnerabilities like Ether Lost in Transfer.
