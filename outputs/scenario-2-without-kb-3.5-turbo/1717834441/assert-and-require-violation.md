# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract AssertRequireVulnerability {
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function mint(uint256 amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can mint");
        totalSupply += amount;
        assert(totalSupply > 0); // Vulnerability: Incorrect use of assert
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract is on line 14 where the `assert` statement is used to check if the `totalSupply` is greater than 0 after minting new tokens. Using `assert` in this context is incorrect as it should not be used for checking conditions that can be violated by external factors such as user input.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Replace the `assert` statement with a `require` statement to handle the condition appropriately without consuming all remaining gas. For example:
```solidity
function mint(uint256 amount) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can mint");
    totalSupply += amount;
    require(totalSupply > 0, "Total supply must be greater than 0");
}
```

- Remediation 2: Implement additional checks or validations to ensure that the `totalSupply` remains valid and does not reach an invalid state due to external factors. This can involve more comprehensive input validation and error handling mechanisms.
