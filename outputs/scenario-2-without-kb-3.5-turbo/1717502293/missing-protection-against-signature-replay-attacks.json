Although the function performs signature verification using ECDSA, it does not check whether the signature has been used before. This omission allows an attacker to replay a valid signature multiple times, bypassing the verification and executing the function to transfer ownership repeatedly.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- One way to mitigate this vulnerability is to include a nonce or a unique identifier in the signed message. The smart contract should maintain a mapping of used nonces to prevent replay attacks. Each time a signature is used, the corresponding nonce should be marked as used to prevent its reuse.\n  \n- Another approach is to include a timestamp or a block number in the signed message. By checking the validity period of the signature based on the timestamp, the contract can prevent replay attacks by rejecting signatures that are too old or too far in the future.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Missing Protection against Signature Replay Attacks vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nLỗ hổng này xảy ra khi smart contract thực hiện xác thực chữ ký nhưng không kiểm tra xem chữ ký đã được sử dụng hay chưa. Kẻ tấn công có thể tái sử dụng chữ ký nhiều lần để vượt qua xác thực và thực thi hàm.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Missing Protection against Signature Replay Attacks vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
