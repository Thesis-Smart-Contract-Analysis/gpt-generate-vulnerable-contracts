This can lead to a Denial of Service attack by consuming all the gas available in a block, making the contract unresponsive.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Avoid using infinite loops in smart contracts as they can lead to gas exhaustion and block gas limit DoS vulnerabilities. Ensure that loops have a clear exit condition.\n- Implement gas limits and constraints in functions to prevent excessive gas consumption. Consider breaking down large operations into smaller, more manageable steps to mitigate DoS attacks.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Denial of Service with Block Gas Limit vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nCác lời gọi đến bên ngoài smart contract (thực thi hàm hoặc chuyển ETH) có thể thất bại một cách không có hoặc có chủ đích. Trong trường hợp kẻ tấn công gọi đến bên ngoài smart contract nhiều lần trong cùng một giao dịch, smart contract có thể trở nên không khả dụng.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Denial of Service with Block Gas Limit vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
