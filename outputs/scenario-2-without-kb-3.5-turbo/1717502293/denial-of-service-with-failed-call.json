If the external call fails intentionally or unintentionally, it can lead to a denial of service attack as an attacker can repeatedly call this function within the same transaction, causing the contract to become unresponsive.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Implement a check on the return value of the external call to handle failures gracefully. You can use the `require` statement to revert the transaction if the external call fails.\n- Consider using the `transfer` or `send` functions instead of `call` for sending Ether to external addresses as they handle failures by reverting the transaction automatically.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Denial of Service with Failed Call vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nCác lời gọi đến bên ngoài smart contract (thực thi hàm hoặc chuyển ETH) có thể thất bại một cách không có hoặc có chủ đích. Trong trường hợp kẻ tấn công gọi đến bên ngoài smart contract nhiều lần trong cùng một giao dịch, smart contract có thể trở nên không khả dụng.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Denial of Service with Failed Call vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
