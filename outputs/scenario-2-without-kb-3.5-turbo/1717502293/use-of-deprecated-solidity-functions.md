# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DeprecatedFunctionExample {
    uint public data;

    function setData(uint _data) public {
        data = _data;
    }

    function getData() public view returns (uint) {
        return data;
    }

    function getGasLeft() public view returns (uint) {
        return gasleft(); // Vulnerability: Use of deprecated 'gasleft' function
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract is on line 13 where the deprecated function `gasleft()` is used. In newer versions of Solidity, the `gasleft()` function has been deprecated and should not be used as it may lead to compilation errors or unintended behavior.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Replace the deprecated `gasleft()` function with the `gasleft` global variable to get the gas remaining in the current call.
- Remediation 2: Update the code to use alternative methods provided in the latest Solidity version for obtaining gas-related information.
