In this case, the `DoubleConstructorVulnerability` contract has both a function named `DoubleConstructorVulnerability` and a constructor named `constructor`. This can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior as it is unclear which constructor will be executed.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- To fix the Double Constructor vulnerability, it is recommended to have only one constructor in the smart contract. You can choose to keep the constructor with the name `constructor` for clarity and consistency.\n- Remove the function `DoubleConstructorVulnerability` and keep only the constructor function to ensure that there is no ambiguity in the contract's initialization logic.",

Hàm tạo nào được định nghĩa trước sẽ được thực thi.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Double Constructor vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
