# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TypoVulnerableContract {
    uint public balance;

    constructor() {
        balance = 1000;
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        balane -= _amount; // line 11
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

In the `withdraw` function of the smart contract, there is a typographical error on line 11 where `balane` is used instead of `balance`. This typo can lead to unintended behavior in the contract, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the `balance` incorrectly.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: To fix this vulnerability, the developer should carefully review and correct all variable names to ensure they are spelled correctly. In this case, changing `balane` to `balance` on line 11 will resolve the typo issue.
- Remediation 2: Implementing automated code reviews and testing processes can help catch such typographical errors before deployment to the blockchain, reducing the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities.
