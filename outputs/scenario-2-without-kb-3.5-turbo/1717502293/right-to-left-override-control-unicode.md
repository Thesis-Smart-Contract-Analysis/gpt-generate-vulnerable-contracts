# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    string public fileName;

    constructor(string memory _input) {
        fileName = _input;
    }

    function updateFileName(string memory _newName) public {
        fileName = _newName;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

The vulnerability lies in the fact that an attacker can exploit the Right-To-Left Override Control Character by inserting it within the `_newName` parameter when calling the `updateFileName` function. This can lead to misleading or deceptive file names being displayed to users.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Implement input validation by checking for the presence of the Right-To-Left Override Control Character (U+202E) in the `_newName` parameter before updating the `fileName`. Reject any input containing this character.
- Remediation 2: Normalize the input string to ensure that any potentially malicious characters, including the Right-To-Left Override Control Character, are removed or neutralized before updating the `fileName`. This can be achieved by using libraries or functions that handle string sanitization.
