# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TimestampDependencyVulnerable {
    address public owner;
    uint public unlockTime;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        unlockTime = block.timestamp + 3600; // Vulnerable line
    }

    function unlock() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can unlock");
        require(block.timestamp >= unlockTime, "Unlock time has not arrived yet");
        
        // Unlock logic
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the line where the `unlockTime` is calculated based on `block.timestamp`. This creates a Timestamp Dependency vulnerability as the `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners, leading to unexpected behavior in the contract's logic.

# Remediations

- **Use block.number instead of block.timestamp**: Instead of relying on `block.timestamp`, consider using `block.number` for time-dependent operations. While `block.number` is also not entirely immune to manipulation, it is less susceptible compared to `block.timestamp`.
  
- **Implement a time oracle**: Utilize an external time oracle to fetch the current time instead of relying on blockchain timestamps. This approach can provide more accurate and tamper-resistant time information for your smart contract.
