Using an outdated compiler version can expose the smart contract to known vulnerabilities and issues that have been publicly disclosed. This can potentially lead to security risks and exploits.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1: Upgrade the compiler version to the latest stable version available at the time of development. By using an up-to-date compiler version, you can benefit from the latest security enhancements and bug fixes provided by the Solidity team.\n- Remediation 2: Regularly monitor and update the compiler version used in the smart contract to ensure that it stays current with the latest developments in the Solidity language. This proactive approach can help mitigate the risks associated with using outdated compiler versions.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Outdated Compiler Version vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nSử dụng một phiên bản trình biên dịch đã cũ có thể gây ra các vấn đề, đặc biệt là khi phiên bản đó có các lỗi và sự cố đã được tiết lộ công khai.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Outdated Compiler Version vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
