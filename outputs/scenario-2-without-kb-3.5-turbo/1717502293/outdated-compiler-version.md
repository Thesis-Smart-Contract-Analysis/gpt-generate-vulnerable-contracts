# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract OutdatedCompiler {
    uint public data;

    function setData(uint _data) public {
        data = _data;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in this smart contract is the use of an outdated compiler version (0.4.24). Using an outdated compiler version can expose the smart contract to known vulnerabilities and issues that have been publicly disclosed. This can potentially lead to security risks and exploits.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Upgrade the compiler version to the latest stable version available at the time of development. By using an up-to-date compiler version, you can benefit from the latest security enhancements and bug fixes provided by the Solidity team.
- Remediation 2: Regularly monitor and update the compiler version used in the smart contract to ensure that it stays current with the latest developments in the Solidity language. This proactive approach can help mitigate the risks associated with using outdated compiler versions.
