# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DenialOfService {
    function processPayment(address payable _to) public {
        _to.call{value: msg.value}("");
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the `processPayment` function where an external call is made to the address `_to` without checking the return value. If the external call fails intentionally or unintentionally, it can lead to a denial of service attack as an attacker can repeatedly call this function within the same transaction, causing the contract to become unresponsive.

# Remediations

- Implement a check on the return value of the external call to handle failures gracefully. You can use the `require` statement to revert the transaction if the external call fails.
- Consider using the `transfer` or `send` functions instead of `call` for sending Ether to external addresses as they handle failures by reverting the transaction automatically.
