# Smart contract with Frozen Ether vulnerability

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract FrozenEther {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() external payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() external {
        uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "Insufficient balance");
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in this smart contract lies in the fact that it allows users to deposit Ether into the contract but does not provide a way for them to withdraw their funds. This can lead to a situation where Ether gets locked inside the contract, making it inaccessible to the users who deposited it.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Implement a withdrawal function that allows users to withdraw their funds from the contract. This function should deduct the withdrawn amount from the user's balance and transfer the Ether to the user.
  
- **Remediation 2:** Add proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only the rightful owner of the funds can initiate a withdrawal. This can be achieved by using modifiers or require statements to check the caller's identity before allowing a withdrawal.
