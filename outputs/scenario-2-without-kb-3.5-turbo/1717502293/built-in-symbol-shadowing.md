# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SymbolShadowingVulnerable {
    address public msg;
    
    constructor() {
        msg = msg.sender; // line 5
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

In the smart contract above, the vulnerability lies in line 5 where the developer used the identifier `msg` to name a state variable. This is problematic because `msg` is a built-in global variable in Solidity that represents the message data for the current function call. By shadowing this built-in symbol with a user-defined variable, the behavior of the contract can be altered unintentionally, leading to unexpected results and potential security vulnerabilities.

# Remediations

- Avoid using identifiers that are already predefined in Solidity, such as `msg`, `tx`, `block`, etc., for naming variables, functions, modifiers, or events.
- Use descriptive and unique names for identifiers to prevent conflicts with built-in symbols and improve code clarity and maintainability.
