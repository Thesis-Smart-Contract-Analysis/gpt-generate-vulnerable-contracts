# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract FunctionSelectorClash {
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) public {
        // Transfer tokens to the specified address
    }

    function _transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) internal {
        // Internal transfer function
    }

    fallback() external {
        // Fallback function
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in having two functions, `transfer` and `_transfer`, with the same first 4 bytes of their function selectors. This can lead to a Function Selector Clashing vulnerability where the EVM may execute the wrong function unintentionally due to the collision in the function selectors.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** To mitigate the Function Selector Clashing vulnerability, you can add a unique identifier to the function names or use different function names altogether to ensure distinct function selectors. For example, renaming one of the functions to `transferTokens` or `internalTransfer` would resolve the clash.
  
- **Remediation 2:** Another approach is to adjust the function signatures by changing the parameter types or order. This will result in different function selectors and prevent clashes. For instance, modifying the `_transfer` function to accept a different parameter type or changing the order of parameters can help avoid collisions.
