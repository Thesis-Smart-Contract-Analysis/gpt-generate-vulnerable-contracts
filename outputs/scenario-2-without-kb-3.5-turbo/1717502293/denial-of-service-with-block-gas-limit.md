# Smart contract

```solidity
// Vulnerable code
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DenialOfService {
    uint[] public data;

    function addData(uint _data) public {
        data.push(_data);
    }

    function blockGasLimitDoS() public {
        for (uint i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            while (true) {
                // Infinite loop causing gas exhaustion
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability lies in the `blockGasLimitDoS` function where an infinite loop is created within a loop iterating over the `data` array. This can lead to a Denial of Service attack by consuming all the gas available in a block, making the contract unresponsive.

# Remediations

- Avoid using infinite loops in smart contracts as they can lead to gas exhaustion and block gas limit DoS vulnerabilities. Ensure that loops have a clear exit condition.
- Implement gas limits and constraints in functions to prevent excessive gas consumption. Consider breaking down large operations into smaller, more manageable steps to mitigate DoS attacks.
