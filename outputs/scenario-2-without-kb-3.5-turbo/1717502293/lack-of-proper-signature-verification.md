# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        owner = newOwner; // Lack of proper signature verification vulnerability on this line
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract is the lack of proper signature verification when transferring ownership. The `transferOwnership` function allows any caller to change the `owner` of the contract without verifying the authenticity of the request. This can lead to unauthorized ownership changes by malicious actors.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Implement a signature verification mechanism using cryptographic signatures. Require the caller to provide a valid signature that can be verified against the expected signer's address before allowing ownership changes.
- Remediation 2: Utilize access control mechanisms such as OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract to manage ownership and restrict ownership transfer functions to only authorized addresses. This ensures that only designated addresses can modify ownership.
