# Smart contract

```solidity
// Vulnerable smart contract with Weak Sources of Randomness from Chain Attributes
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract WeakRandomness {
    function generateRandomNumber() public view returns (uint) {
        uint randomNumber = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp)));
        return randomNumber;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability lies in the `generateRandomNumber` function where it uses `block.timestamp` as the source of randomness. This approach is insecure as `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners, leading to predictable outcomes and potential exploits in applications relying on randomness.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Use an external source of randomness such as an oracle service to provide a more secure and unpredictable random number generation process. This can involve integrating with trusted off-chain randomness providers to fetch random data for use in the smart contract.

- **Remediation 2:** Implement a commit-reveal scheme where users commit to a random value off-chain, and then reveal it on-chain. This ensures that the random number is not known until the reveal phase, preventing miners from manipulating the outcome based on block attributes.

By implementing these remediations, the smart contract can enhance its security by mitigating the Weak Sources of Randomness from Chain Attributes vulnerability.
