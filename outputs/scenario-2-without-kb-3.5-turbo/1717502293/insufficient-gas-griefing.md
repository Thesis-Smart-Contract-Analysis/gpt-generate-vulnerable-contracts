# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract InsufficientGasGriefing {
    function callAnotherContract(address _contractAddress) external {
        (bool success, ) = _contractAddress.call{gas: 10000}("");
        require(success, "Call to another contract failed");
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability lies in the `callAnotherContract` function where the contract does not check if it has enough gas to call another contract. By specifying a very low amount of gas (10000 in this case), an attacker can intentionally provide insufficient gas to cause the call to another contract to fail, leading to incorrect behavior of the smart contract.

# Remediations

- Use gas stipend or estimate gas: Instead of hardcoding a fixed amount of gas, use gas stipend or estimate gas required for the call to another contract. This ensures that the contract has enough gas to execute the external call.
- Implement gas checks: Before making an external call, check the gas remaining using `gasleft()` and ensure it is sufficient for the call. If not, revert the transaction or handle the gas shortage appropriately.
