contract SignatureMalleabilityVulnerable {
    function verifySignature(bytes32 message, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s, address signer) public pure returns (bool) {
        bytes memory prefix = "\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32";
        bytes32 prefixedHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(prefix, message));

```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the `verifySignature` function where the `ecrecover` function is used to recover the signer's address from the provided signature parameters (v, r, s). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the signature malleability issue allows an attacker to manipulate the signature parameters (v, r, s) to produce a different but valid signature without knowing the private key, exploiting the asymmetric nature of the cryptographic algorithm.

# Remediations

- To mitigate the Signature Malleability vulnerability, one approach is to normalize the signature before performing the verification. This can be achieved by enforcing specific constraints on the signature parameters, such as ensuring `r` and `s` are within a certain range or canonicalizing the signature format.
- Another solution is to use a secure library or implementation that handles signature verification with built-in protections against malleability attacks, such as OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library, which provides safe signature verification functions.
