# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UnencryptedPrivateData {
    uint256 private secretNumber;

    function setSecretNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public {
        secretNumber = _newNumber; // Line with Unencrypted Private Data On-Chain vulnerability
    }

    function getSecretNumber() public view returns (uint256) {
        return secretNumber;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the line where the `secretNumber` variable is being updated in the `setSecretNumber` function. Since the `secretNumber` variable is marked as `private`, it may give a false sense of security. However, any changes made to this variable are recorded on the blockchain, which is a public ledger. This means that the value of `secretNumber` can be easily accessed and analyzed by anyone, compromising its confidentiality.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: To address the Unencrypted Private Data On-Chain vulnerability, sensitive data like `secretNumber` should not be stored directly in the contract state variables. Instead, consider using off-chain storage solutions or encryption techniques to protect the confidentiality of such data.
  
- Remediation 2: Implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can read or modify sensitive data within the smart contract. This can involve using access modifiers, role-based permissions, or encryption to ensure that only authorized parties can interact with the private data.
