# Smart contract

```solidity
contract BaseContract {
    function baseFunction() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Base function";
    }
}

contract ChildContract is BaseContract, AnotherBaseContract {
    function childFunction() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Child function";
    }
}

contract AnotherBaseContract {
    function anotherBaseFunction() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Another base function";
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the above smart contract is the Incorrect Inheritance Order. In the `ChildContract`, the order of inheritance is `BaseContract, AnotherBaseContract`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as the functions from `AnotherBaseContract` may override or interfere with the functions from `BaseContract`.

# Remediations

- To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the order of inheritance is correct and follows the intended hierarchy of contracts. In this case, `BaseContract` should be inherited before `AnotherBaseContract` in the `ChildContract`.
  
```solidity
contract ChildContract is BaseContract, AnotherBaseContract {
    // Contract logic
}
```

- It is recommended to clearly document the inheritance order in the smart contract code to make it easier for developers to understand the contract structure and prevent potential issues related to inheritance order.
