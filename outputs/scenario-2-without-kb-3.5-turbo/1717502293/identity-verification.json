Since the `extcodesize` opcode returns 0 during the contract creation process, an attacker can deploy a malicious contract that executes code within the constructor and bypasses this check, leading to incorrect verification of the identity.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1:** Avoid performing identity verification based on `extcodesize` within the constructor as it can be manipulated by an attacker. Instead, consider moving the verification logic to a separate function that is called after the contract has been deployed.\n  \n- **Remediation 2:** Implement a delayed verification mechanism where the contract waits for a certain number of blocks or a specific time period before verifying the identity. This can help mitigate the risk of attackers exploiting the `extcodesize` vulnerability during contract deployment.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Identity Verification vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nMột số smart contract kiểm tra xem một địa chỉ có phải là smart contract hay không thông qua opcode `extcodesize`.\nTuy nhiên, kẻ tấn công có thể thực thi hàm ở trong hàm tạo và vượt qua được cách kiểm tra trên. Lý do là vì trong quá trình hàm tạo thực thi, giá trị trả về của `extcodesize` sẽ là 0.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Identity Verification vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
