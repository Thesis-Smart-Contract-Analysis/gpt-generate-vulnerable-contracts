In the `ChildContract`, the order of inheritance is `BaseContract, AnotherBaseContract`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as the functions from `AnotherBaseContract` may override or interfere with the functions from `BaseContract`.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the order of inheritance is correct and follows the intended hierarchy of contracts. In this case, `BaseContract` should be inherited before `AnotherBaseContract` in the `ChildContract`.\n  \n```solidity\ncontract ChildContract is BaseContract, AnotherBaseContract {\n    // Contract logic\n}\n```\n\n- It is recommended to clearly document the inheritance order in the smart contract code to make it easier for developers to understand the contract structure and prevent potential issues related to inheritance order.",

The first part of the smart contract has a Incorrect Inheritance Order vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
