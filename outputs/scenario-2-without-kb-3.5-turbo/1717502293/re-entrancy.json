However, the `withdraw` function does not update the sender's balance before transferring the funds. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the `withdraw` function before the balance is updated, resulting in a re-entrancy attack.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Update State Before External Calls**: Ensure that the state variables are updated before making any external calls. In this case, move the deduction of the withdrawn amount from the sender's balance to before the external call to prevent re-entrancy attacks.\n\n- **Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern where you first perform all checks, then update the state, and finally interact with external contracts. This pattern helps prevent re-entrancy vulnerabilities by separating state changes from external calls.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Re-entrancy vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nLà một kiểu tấn công đệ quy tương hỗ xảy ra giữa smart contract của nạn nhân và smart contract của kẻ tấn công. Cụ thể hơn, kẻ tấn công sẽ liên tục gọi lại một hàm trong smart contract của nạn nhân trước khi lời gọi trước đó được thực thi xong.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Re-entrancy vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
