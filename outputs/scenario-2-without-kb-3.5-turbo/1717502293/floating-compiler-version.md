# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract FloatingCompilerVersionVulnerability {
    uint private balance;

    constructor() {
        balance = 100;
    }

    function getBalance() public view returns(uint) {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the pragma statement specifying the compiler version as `^0.8.0`. This indicates that the contract is intended to be compiled using a compiler version greater than or equal to 0.8.0. However, this can lead to a Floating Compiler Version vulnerability as the contract may be compiled with a different compiler version during testing and deployment, potentially causing discrepancies in the contract's behavior.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Specify an exact compiler version in the pragma statement to ensure consistency across testing and deployment environments. For example, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;` instead of `^0.8.0`.
- Remediation 2: Implement thorough testing using the specified compiler version to detect any potential issues that may arise from compiler version discrepancies. Additionally, consider using tools like Truffle or Hardhat to automate testing with the correct compiler version.
