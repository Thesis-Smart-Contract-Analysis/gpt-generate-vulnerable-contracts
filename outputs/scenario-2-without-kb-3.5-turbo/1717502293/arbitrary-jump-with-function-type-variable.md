```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability lies in the `updateBalanceFunction` function where an attacker can exploit the function type variable `_newFunction` to change the reference of the `balances` mapping to any arbitrary instruction, breaking access controls and modifying state variables.

# Remediations

- Use a more restricted data type for the `_newFunction` parameter, such as `address` or a custom struct, to prevent attackers from manipulating the function type variable.
- Implement access control mechanisms within the `updateBalanceFunction` function to restrict who can update the balance function reference.
