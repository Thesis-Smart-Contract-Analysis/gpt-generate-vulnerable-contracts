# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HashCollisionVulnerability {
    function hashCollisionVulnerability(uint256[] memory data1, uint256[] memory data2) public pure returns(bytes32) {
        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(data1, data2)); // line 5
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in line 5 where the `abi.encodePacked` function is used to concatenate two arrays `data1` and `data2`. This can lead to a Hash Collisions with Multiple Variable Length Arguments vulnerability because `abi.encodePacked` does not differentiate between the elements of the arrays, potentially causing hash collisions.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** To mitigate the Hash Collisions vulnerability, you can use a delimiter or a specific structure to separate the arrays before encoding them. For example, you can add a unique separator between the arrays to ensure distinct encoding.

- **Remediation 2:** Another approach is to individually hash each array before combining them. By hashing each array separately and then hashing the resulting hashes together, you can reduce the risk of hash collisions. This way, the uniqueness of each array's content is preserved.
