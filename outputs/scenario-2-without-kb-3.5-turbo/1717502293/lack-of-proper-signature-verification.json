The `transferOwnership` function allows any caller to change the `owner` of the contract without verifying the authenticity of the request. This can lead to unauthorized ownership changes by malicious actors.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1: Implement a signature verification mechanism using cryptographic signatures. Require the caller to provide a valid signature that can be verified against the expected signer's address before allowing ownership changes.\n- Remediation 2: Utilize access control mechanisms such as OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract to manage ownership and restrict ownership transfer functions to only authorized addresses. This ensures that only designated addresses can modify ownership.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Lack of Proper Signature Verification vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nXảy ra khi smart contract không thực hiện kiểm tra tính hợp lệ của chữ ký khi thực hiện những thao tác nhạy cảm. Kẻ tấn công có thể lợi dụng điều này để vượt qua xác thực nhằm thực hiện những hành vi không được phép.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Lack of Proper Signature Verification vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
