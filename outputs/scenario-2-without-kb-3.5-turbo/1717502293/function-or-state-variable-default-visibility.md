# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DefaultVisibilityVulnerability {
    uint private secretNumber;

    function setSecretNumber(uint _newNumber) {
        secretNumber = _newNumber;
    }

    function getSecretNumber() returns (uint) {
        return secretNumber;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract is that the visibility of the functions `setSecretNumber` and `getSecretNumber` is not explicitly specified. By default, functions in Solidity are public, so these functions can be accessed by anyone, including external contracts and accounts.

# Remediations

- Explicitly specify the visibility of functions to prevent unintended access. In this case, you should add `private` visibility to the functions `setSecretNumber` and `getSecretNumber`.
- Update the functions as follows:

```solidity
function setSecretNumber(uint _newNumber) private {
    secretNumber = _newNumber;
}

function getSecretNumber() private view returns (uint) {
    return secretNumber;
}
```

By making the functions `private`, you restrict access to them only within the smart contract, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized external access.
