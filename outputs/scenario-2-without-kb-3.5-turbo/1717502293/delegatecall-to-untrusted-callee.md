# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Caller {
    address public trustedCallee;

    constructor(address _trustedCallee) {
        trustedCallee = _trustedCallee;
    }

    function executeDelegateCall(address _untrustedCallee, bytes memory _data) public {
        (bool success, ) = _untrustedCallee.delegatecall(_data); // Vulnerable line
        require(success, "Delegatecall failed");
    }
}

contract UntrustedCallee {
    uint public data;

    function maliciousFunction() public {
        data = 999;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability lies in the `executeDelegateCall` function of the `Caller` contract where it uses `delegatecall` to call a function on an untrusted contract (`_untrustedCallee`). This allows the untrusted contract to manipulate the state variables of the `Caller` contract, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or ownership takeovers.

# Remediations

- Avoid using `delegatecall` to call functions from untrusted contracts. Instead, consider using `call` with carefully crafted interfaces to limit the capabilities of the called contract.
- Implement proper access control mechanisms and validation checks before executing delegate calls to ensure that only authorized and trusted contracts can interact with critical functions.
