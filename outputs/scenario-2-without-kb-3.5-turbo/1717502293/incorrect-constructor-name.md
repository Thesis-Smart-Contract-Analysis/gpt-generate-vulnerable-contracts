# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IncorrectConstructorName {
    address public owner;

    function MyContract() { // Vulnerable line
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the above smart contract is that the constructor function is named `MyContract` instead of the same name as the smart contract `IncorrectConstructorName`. This naming mismatch makes the function a regular function instead of a constructor, allowing it to be called by anyone, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Rename the function to match the smart contract name to make it a constructor.
- Remediation 2: Use the correct constructor syntax in Solidity starting from version 0.4.22 by using `constructor()` instead of relying on the function name to define the constructor. 

By following these remediations, you can ensure that the constructor function is properly defined and executed only during contract deployment, enhancing the security and integrity of the smart contract.
