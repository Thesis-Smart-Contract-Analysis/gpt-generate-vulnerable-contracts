The `maliciousContract` variable is of type `MaliciousContract` and is initialized with an address passed in the constructor. This allows an attacker to deploy a malicious contract and pass its address to the `VulnerableContract`, hiding the fact that it is a malicious contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Use interface to interact with external contracts: Instead of directly instantiating an external contract, define an interface that specifies the functions of the external contract. This way, the `VulnerableContract` can interact with the external contract through the interface without exposing the actual contract implementation.\n\n- Implement access control: Add access control mechanisms to restrict interactions with external contracts to only trusted addresses. This can prevent unauthorized contracts from being used in place of the intended external contract.",

Kẻ tấn công có thể lợi dụng điều này để giấu mã độc @hiding-malicious-code-with-external-contract-ref.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Hiding Malicious Code with External Contract vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
