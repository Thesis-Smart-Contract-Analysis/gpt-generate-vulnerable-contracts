# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    function executeUnknownFunction(address _target) external {
        (bool success, ) = _target.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("nonExistentFunction()"));
        require(success, "Call failed");
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        // Vulnerability: This fallback function can be exploited by an attacker to perform re-entrancy or denial of service attacks.
        // An attacker can deploy a malicious contract with a fallback function that triggers unexpected behavior when called by this contract.
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability lies in the `fallback` function of the `VulnerableContract`. This fallback function can be exploited by an attacker to perform re-entrancy or denial of service attacks. An attacker can deploy a malicious contract with a fallback function that triggers unexpected behavior when called by this contract.

# Remediations

- Avoid calling unknown functions or contracts within the fallback function. Implement strict checks and validations before making external calls.
- Implement a receive function to handle incoming Ether transactions instead of relying solely on the fallback function. This can help prevent unexpected behavior triggered by Ether transfers.
