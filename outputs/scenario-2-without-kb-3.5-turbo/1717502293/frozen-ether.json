This can lead to a situation where Ether gets locked inside the contract, making it inaccessible to the users who deposited it.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1:** Implement a withdrawal function that allows users to withdraw their funds from the contract. This function should deduct the withdrawn amount from the user's balance and transfer the Ether to the user.\n  \n- **Remediation 2:** Add proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only the rightful owner of the funds can initiate a withdrawal. This can be achieved by using modifiers or require statements to check the caller's identity before allowing a withdrawal.",

The first part of the smart contract has a Frozen Ether vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
