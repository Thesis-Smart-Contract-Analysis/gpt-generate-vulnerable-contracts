# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.22;

contract DoubleConstructorVulnerability {
    uint public data;

    function DoubleConstructorVulnerability() public {
        data = 100;
    }

    constructor() public {
        data = 200;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in having two constructors defined with different names but serving the same purpose. In this case, the `DoubleConstructorVulnerability` contract has both a function named `DoubleConstructorVulnerability` and a constructor named `constructor`. This can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior as it is unclear which constructor will be executed.

# Remediations

- To fix the Double Constructor vulnerability, it is recommended to have only one constructor in the smart contract. You can choose to keep the constructor with the name `constructor` for clarity and consistency.
- Remove the function `DoubleConstructorVulnerability` and keep only the constructor function to ensure that there is no ambiguity in the contract's initialization logic.
