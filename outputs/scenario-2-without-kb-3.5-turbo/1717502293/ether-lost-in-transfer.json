This can lead to Ether being lost if the recipient address is a contract that does not handle received Ether properly.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Use the Withdrawal Pattern: Implement a withdrawal pattern where users must explicitly withdraw their funds instead of having a function that allows anyone to withdraw the contract's balance. This pattern ensures that only intended recipients can withdraw Ether from the contract.\n\n- Implement Checks on Recipient Address: Add checks in the `withdraw` function to verify that the recipient address is a valid and trusted address. This can prevent Ether from being sent to unintended or malicious contracts.\n\n- Use the Pull Payment Pattern: Instead of pushing funds to external addresses, consider implementing a pull payment pattern where users initiate the withdrawal process themselves. This gives users more control over their funds and reduces the risk of Ether being lost in transfers.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Ether Lost in Transfer vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nETH được chuyển vào các địa chỉ mồ côi (không gắn liền với bất kỳ người dùng hoặc smart contract nào) sẽ bị mất hoàn toàn.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Ether Lost in Transfer vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
