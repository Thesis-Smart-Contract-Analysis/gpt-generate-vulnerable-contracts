Once the contract is deployed, the `balance` variable is initialized to 1000 in the constructor. However, the `balance` can be manipulated by the owner through the `withdraw` function. This means that the owner can potentially drain the entire balance of the contract, leading to loss of funds.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1:** To fix this vulnerability, you can make the `balance` variable immutable by declaring it as `immutable`. This will prevent the owner from modifying the balance after deployment.\n  \n- **Remediation 2:** Implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can withdraw funds from the contract. You can use a modifier to check if the caller is the owner before allowing the withdrawal to occur.",

Các lỗi này có thể bị khai thác bởi kẻ tấn công và thiệt hại gây ra là không thể khôi phục #footnote[The DAO là ngoại lệ duy nhất].\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Immutable Bugs vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
