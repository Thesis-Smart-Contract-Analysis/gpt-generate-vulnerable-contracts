# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ParentContract {
    uint256 public data = 100;
}

contract ChildContract is ParentContract {
    uint256 public data = 200; // Line with Shadowing State Variables vulnerability
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the above smart contract is the Shadowing State Variables issue. Both the `ParentContract` and `ChildContract` declare a state variable named `data`. This can lead to confusion and unintended behavior as the child contract's `data` variable shadows the parent contract's `data` variable.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Avoid declaring state variables with the same name in both the parent and child contracts. Use unique variable names to prevent shadowing and potential conflicts.
- Remediation 2: Use inheritance carefully and consider the naming conventions to differentiate between variables in parent and child contracts to prevent unintended shadowing.
