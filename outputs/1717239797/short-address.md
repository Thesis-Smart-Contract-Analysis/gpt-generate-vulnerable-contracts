```solidity
// Smart contract with Short Address Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ShortAddressVulnerability {
    
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
    
}
```

In the smart contract above, the `transferOwnership` function allows the owner to transfer ownership to a new address. However, it is vulnerable to the Short Address Attack. In this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a transaction where the `newOwner` address is shorter than 20 bytes, causing the input data to be padded with zeros. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.

### Remediation:
To mitigate the Short Address Vulnerability, you can implement a check to ensure that the length of the input address is exactly 20 bytes. Here is the remediated version of the smart contract:

```solidity
// Smart contract with Remediation for Short Address Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ShortAddressVulnerabilityFixed {
    
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        require(_newOwner != address(0), "Invalid new owner address");
        require(_newOwner == address(uint160(_newOwner)), "Invalid new owner address length");
        
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
    
}
```

In the remediated version, the `transferOwnership` function now includes additional checks:
1. Ensuring that the `_newOwner` address is not the zero address.
2. Ensuring that the length of the `_newOwner` address is exactly 20 bytes by comparing it with `address(uint160(_newOwner))`.

By implementing these checks, you can prevent the Short Address Vulnerability in your smart contract.
