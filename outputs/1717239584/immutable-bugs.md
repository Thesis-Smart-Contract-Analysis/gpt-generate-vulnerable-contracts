```solidity
// Smart contract with Immutable Bugs vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ImmutableBug {
    uint256 private immutable secretNumber;

    constructor(uint256 _secretNumber) {
        secretNumber = _secretNumber;
    }

    function getSecretNumber() public view returns (uint256) {
        return secretNumber;
    }

    function updateSecretNumber(uint256 _newSecretNumber) public {
        secretNumber = _newSecretNumber; // This will cause an error due to attempting to modify an immutable variable
    }
}
```

In the smart contract `ImmutableBug` above, the variable `secretNumber` is declared as `immutable`, meaning it cannot be modified after initialization. However, the function `updateSecretNumber` is attempting to modify the `immutable` variable, which will result in a compilation error.

## Remediation:

To fix the Immutable Bugs vulnerability, you should ensure that `immutable` variables are only assigned a value once during contract deployment and cannot be modified thereafter. If you need to update the value of a variable, consider using a regular state variable instead of an `immutable` variable.

Here is the remediated version of the smart contract:

```solidity
// Smart contract with Immutable Bugs vulnerability remediated

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ImmutableBugFixed {
    uint256 private secretNumber;

    constructor(uint256 _secretNumber) {
        secretNumber = _secretNumber;
    }

    function getSecretNumber() public view returns (uint256) {
        return secretNumber;
    }

    function updateSecretNumber(uint256 _newSecretNumber) public {
        secretNumber = _newSecretNumber; // This is allowed for regular state variables
    }
}
```

In the remediated version `ImmutableBugFixed`, the `secretNumber` variable is a regular state variable that can be updated using the `updateSecretNumber` function. This ensures that the contract does not attempt to modify an `immutable` variable, eliminating the Immutable Bugs vulnerability.
