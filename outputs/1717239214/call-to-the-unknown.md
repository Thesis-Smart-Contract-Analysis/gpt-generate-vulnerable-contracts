Below is a vulnerable smart contract that has the Call to the Unknown vulnerability:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        
        // Vulnerability: Call to unknown address without checking
        (bool success, ) = _newOwner.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("receiveOwnership()"));
        require(success, "Ownership transfer failed");
    }
}
```

In the `transferOwnership` function of the `VulnerableContract`, there is a vulnerability where it calls a function `receiveOwnership()` on the `_newOwner` address without verifying if the function actually exists in the contract at that address. This can lead to unexpected behavior or potential security risks.

### Remediation:

To remediate the Call to the Unknown vulnerability, you should follow these best practices:

1. **Use Interface**: Define an interface that specifies the functions that the `_newOwner` contract should implement. This way, you can ensure that the function being called actually exists in the contract.

```solidity
interface IOwnership {
    function receiveOwnership() external;
}

contract VulnerableContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        
        IOwnership newOwnerContract = IOwnership(_newOwner);
        newOwnerContract.receiveOwnership();
    }
}
```

2. **Whitelist Trusted Addresses**: Maintain a whitelist of trusted addresses that can be called using `delegatecall` or `call`. Only allow calls to addresses that are on the whitelist to prevent calling unknown or untrusted contracts.

3. **Use Safe External Calls**: Consider using libraries like OpenZeppelin's `Address.sol` to perform external calls safely. These libraries provide additional checks and safeguards to prevent unexpected behavior.

By implementing these remediation steps, you can mitigate the risks associated with the Call to the Unknown vulnerability in your smart contract.
