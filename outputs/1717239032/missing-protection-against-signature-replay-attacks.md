```solidity
// Smart Contract with Missing Protection against Signature Replay Attacks Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SignatureReplayVulnerability {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount, bytes memory signature) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        
        // Verify signature (simplified for demonstration purposes)
        require(verifySignature(msg.sender, amount, signature), "Invalid signature");

        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }

    function verifySignature(address account, uint256 amount, bytes memory signature) internal pure returns (bool) {
        // Simplified signature verification logic
        return true;
    }
}
```

In the above smart contract, the `withdraw` function allows users to withdraw funds by providing a signature. However, there is no protection against signature replay attacks, where an attacker can reuse a valid signature to repeatedly withdraw funds.

## Remediation:

To protect against signature replay attacks, you can implement a nonce-based solution where each withdrawal request includes a unique nonce that prevents replay attacks. Here is an updated version of the smart contract with nonce-based protection:

```solidity
// Smart Contract with Protection against Signature Replay Attacks

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SignatureReplayProtection {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    mapping(address => uint256) public nonces;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount, bytes memory signature, uint256 nonce) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        
        // Verify signature and nonce
        require(verifySignature(msg.sender, amount, signature, nonce), "Invalid signature or nonce");

        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        nonces[msg.sender]++;
    }

    function verifySignature(address account, uint256 amount, bytes memory signature, uint256 nonce) internal pure returns (bool) {
        // Simplified signature and nonce verification logic
        return true;
    }
}
```

In the remediated version, a `nonce` parameter is added to the `withdraw` function, and the `verifySignature` function now includes the nonce in the verification process. The `nonce` should be incremented after each successful withdrawal to ensure uniqueness and prevent replay attacks.
