// Smart Contract with Call to the Unknown Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        
        // Vulnerability: Call to unknown address
        (bool success, ) = _newOwner.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("receiveOwnership()"));
        require(success, "Transfer ownership failed");
    }
    
}

contract MaliciousContract {
    
    address public owner;
    
    function receiveOwnership() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
}
```

In the `VulnerableContract`, the `transferOwnership` function allows the owner to transfer ownership to a new address. However, it uses a `call` function to call the `receiveOwnership` function on the `_newOwner` address, which can be any address provided by the owner. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.

### Remediation:

To mitigate the Call to the Unknown vulnerability, you can follow these remediation steps:

1. **Whitelist Trusted Addresses**: Maintain a whitelist of trusted addresses that the contract can interact with. Only allow calls to addresses on the whitelist.

2. **Use Interface**: Define an interface that specifies the functions that can be called by external contracts. Ensure that the external contract implements this interface before making the call.

3. **Explicit Function Signature**: Instead of using `abi.encodeWithSignature`, explicitly define the function signature to be called. This helps prevent accidental calls to unintended functions.

Here is an updated version of the `VulnerableContract` with remediation:

```solidity
// Smart Contract with Remediation for Call to the Unknown Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IOwnership {
    function receiveOwnership() external;
}

contract SecureContract {
    
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        
        IOwnership newOwnerContract = IOwnership(_newOwner);
        newOwnerContract.receiveOwnership();
        
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
    
}
```

In the remediated `SecureContract`, we have introduced an interface `IOwnership` that specifies the `receiveOwnership` function. Before calling the function on the `_newOwner` address, we ensure that the address implements this interface. This helps prevent unintended calls to unknown functions.
