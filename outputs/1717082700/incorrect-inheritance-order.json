However, the constructors are called in the wrong order in the inheritance chain. The correct order should be `A` -> `B` -> `C`, but the constructors are called in the order `B` -> `A` -> `C`.\n\n### Remediation:\n\nTo fix the Incorrect Inheritance Order vulnerability, you should ensure that the constructors are called in the correct order in the inheritance chain. In this case, the constructors should be called in the order `A` -> `B` -> `C`.\n\nHere is the remediated version of the smart contract:\n\n```solidity\n// Corrected Inheritance Order\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract A {\n    uint public a;\n\n    constructor(uint _a) {\n        a = _a;\n    }\n}\n\ncontract B is A {\n    uint public b;\n\n    constructor(uint _a, uint _b) A(_a) {\n        b = _b;\n    }\n}\n\ncontract C is B {\n    uint public c;\n\n    constructor(uint _a, uint _b, uint _c) B(_a, _b) {\n        c = _c;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy ensuring that the constructors are called in the correct order, you can mitigate the Incorrect Inheritance Order vulnerability in your smart contract."
