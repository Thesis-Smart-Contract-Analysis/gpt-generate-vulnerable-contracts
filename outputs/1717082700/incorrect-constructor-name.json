The constructor function should have the same name as the contract name.\n\n## Remediation:\n\nTo fix the Incorrect Constructor Name vulnerability, you should rename the constructor function to match the contract name. Here is the remediated version of the smart contract:\n\n```solidity\n// Corrected Constructor Name\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract CorrectedConstructorName {\n    address public owner;\n\n    // Corrected constructor name, matches the contract name\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy renaming the constructor function to match the contract name, you ensure that the constructor is correctly identified and executed when the contract is deployed."
