```solidity
// Incorrect Constructor Name Vulnerability Example

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IncorrectConstructorName {
    address public owner;

    // Incorrect constructor name, should be the same as the contract name
    function IncorrectConstructorName() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}
```

In the above example, the constructor function has a different name than the contract name, which is incorrect. The constructor function should have the same name as the contract name.

## Remediation:

To fix the Incorrect Constructor Name vulnerability, you should rename the constructor function to match the contract name. Here is the remediated version of the smart contract:

```solidity
// Corrected Constructor Name

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CorrectedConstructorName {
    address public owner;

    // Corrected constructor name, matches the contract name
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}
```

By renaming the constructor function to match the contract name, you ensure that the constructor is correctly identified and executed when the contract is deployed.
