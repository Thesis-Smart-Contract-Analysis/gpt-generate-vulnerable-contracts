```solidity
// Smart Contract with Denial of Service with Failed Call Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DenialOfService {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }

    function() external payable {
        // Revert the call to prevent receiving Ether from unknown sources
        revert();
    }
}
```

In the smart contract above, the `withdraw` function allows users to withdraw funds from their balance. However, the vulnerability lies in the `msg.sender.call` line, where the contract tries to transfer Ether to the caller. If the call to `msg.sender` fails, the `require(success)` check will revert the transaction, but the gas will already be consumed, leading to a denial of service attack.

### Remediation:
To mitigate the Denial of Service with Failed Call vulnerability, you can implement the following remediation steps:

1. **Use Transfer Method**: Instead of using `msg.sender.call`, use the `transfer` method which automatically reverts if the transfer fails, preventing the need for an explicit check.

2. **Limit Gas Usage**: Implement gas limits in critical functions to prevent attackers from consuming excessive gas.

3. **Use Withdrawal Pattern**: Implement a withdrawal pattern where users need to explicitly withdraw their funds, rather than relying on a function to send funds automatically.

Here is the updated `withdraw` function with the remediation:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint amount) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
}
```

By using the `transfer` method instead of `call`, the vulnerability is mitigated as the transfer will automatically revert if it fails, preventing a potential denial of service attack.
