# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract Relayer {
  
  uint transactionId;

  struct Tx {
    bytes data;
    bool executed;
  }

  mapping (uint => Tx) transactions;

  function relay(Target target, bytes memory _data) public returns(bool) {
    // replay protection; do not call the same transaction twice
    require(transactions[transactionId].executed == false, 'same transaction twice');
    transactions[transactionId].data = _data;
    transactions[transactionId].executed = true;
    transactionId += 1;

    (bool success, ) = address(target).call(abi.encodeWithSignature("execute(bytes)", _data));
    return success;
  }
  
}

contract Target {
  
  function execute(bytes memory _data) public {
    // Execute contract code
  }
  
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the above smart contract:

The vulnerability lies in the `Relayer` contract's `relay` function where it does not check if there is enough gas provided to execute the call to the `Target` contract. An attacker can provide just enough gas to execute the `relay` function but not enough to execute the `execute` function in the `Target` contract, leading to an out-of-gas exception and potentially affecting the execution result of the smart contract.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Implement gas estimation and validation in the `Relayer` contract to ensure that there is enough gas provided for the entire execution flow, including the call to the `Target` contract. This can be achieved by estimating the gas needed for the `execute` function and deducting the gas needed for internal operations in the `Relayer` contract before making the external call.

- **Remediation 2:** Implement a gas check mechanism to verify that the gas provided is sufficient for the entire transaction flow. This can involve setting a minimum gas requirement based on the estimated gas consumption of the external call and deducting the gas needed for internal operations in the `Relayer` contract before proceeding with the external call.
