# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() { // Line 7: Missing visibility specifier
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the above smart contract: The `withdrawWinnings` function in the smart contract `HashForEther` does not have an explicit visibility specifier, making its visibility default to `public`. This can lead to unintended behavior as any external account can call this function.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Explicitly specify the visibility of functions to prevent unintended access. In this case, you can change the `withdrawWinnings` function to `public` and `_sendWinnings` function to `internal`.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {
  
  function withdrawWinnings() public {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0.
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() internal {
     msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }

}
```

Explicitly specifying the visibility of functions enhances security by clearly defining who can access them, reducing the risk of unauthorized calls.
