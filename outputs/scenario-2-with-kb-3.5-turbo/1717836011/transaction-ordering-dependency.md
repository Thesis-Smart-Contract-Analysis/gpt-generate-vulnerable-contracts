# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TransactionOrderingDependency {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the above smart contract:

The vulnerability in this smart contract lies in the `withdraw` function. An attacker can exploit the Transaction Ordering Dependency vulnerability by front-running the `withdraw` function call. If the attacker monitors pending transactions and notices a withdrawal with a high gas price, they can quickly submit a transaction to drain the victim's balance before the victim's withdrawal is processed.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1: Use a Withdraw Pattern**
  Implement a withdraw pattern where the user initiates a withdrawal request, and the funds are transferred to the user after a delay or in a separate transaction. This prevents front-running attacks by separating the request from the actual transfer of funds.

- **Remediation 2: Use Mutex Locks**
  Implement mutex locks to prevent reentrancy and ensure that only one withdrawal can be processed at a time. This can help mitigate the risk of front-running attacks by ensuring that withdrawals are processed sequentially and not concurrently.

By applying these remediations, you can enhance the security of the smart contract and protect it against Transaction Ordering Dependency vulnerabilities.
