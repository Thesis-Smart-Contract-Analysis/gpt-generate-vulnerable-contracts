# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.21;

contract GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge {
  
  uint8 answer;

  function GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge() public payable {
    require(msg.value == 1 wei);
    answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
  }

  function isComplete() public view returns (bool) {
    return address(this).balance == 0;
  }

  function guess(uint8 n) public payable {
    require(msg.value == 1 wei);

    if (n == answer) {
        msg.sender.transfer(2 wei);
    }
  }
  
}
```

Description of the vulnerability: The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the usage of `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` and `now` to generate the random number `answer`. These values are easily predictable and manipulable by miners, making the randomness weak and exploitable.

# Remediations

- **Verifiable Random Function (VRF):** Implement a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) such as Chainlink VRF to generate random numbers that are verifiable and secure. VRF provides cryptographic proofs for the randomness generated off-chain, ensuring integrity and authenticity.

- **Commit-Reveal Scheme:** Utilize a commit-reveal scheme where participants commit to a secret number, reveal it later, and use the revealed numbers to generate randomness. This scheme ensures fairness and discourages manipulation by penalizing participants who do not reveal their secrets.

- **Bitcoin Hashes:** Consider using Bitcoin block hashes as a source of randomness, as they are inherently difficult to manipulate due to the Proof of Work mechanism in Bitcoin. This can provide a more secure source of randomness compared to chain attributes like `blockhash` and `block.timestamp`.

By implementing these remediations, the smart contract can enhance the security and reliability of its random number generation mechanism.
