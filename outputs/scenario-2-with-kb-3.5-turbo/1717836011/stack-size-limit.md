# Smart contract with Stack Size Limit vulnerability

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract StackSizeVulnerable {
    uint public counter = 0;

    function increaseCounter() public {
        if (counter < 10) {
            counter++;
            this.increaseCounter(); // Vulnerable line
        }
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the above smart contract:
The vulnerability lies in the recursive function `increaseCounter` that calls itself without any termination condition based on the call stack depth. This can lead to a stack overflow issue when the function is recursively called multiple times, exceeding the call stack limit.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Implement a termination condition in the recursive function to prevent excessive call stack depth. For example, limit the number of recursive calls or introduce a condition to exit the recursion based on a specific criteria.

- **Remediation 2:** Refactor the logic to avoid recursive calls altogether. Consider using iterative approaches or breaking down the logic into smaller functions that do not rely on recursive calls to achieve the desired outcome.
