# Smart contract with Ether Lost in Transfer vulnerability

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract EtherLostInTransfer {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferEther(address _recipient) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer Ether");
        _recipient.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the above smart contract:
The vulnerability in this smart contract is on line 11, where the `transferEther` function transfers all the Ether stored in the contract to the `_recipient` address without checking if the recipient address is a smart contract or a regular user address. If the recipient address is a smart contract that does not have a payable fallback function, the Ether will be lost in the transfer.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Before transferring Ether to the recipient address, perform a check to ensure that the recipient address is a regular user address or a known smart contract with a payable fallback function. This can be done by implementing a whitelist of trusted addresses or using a mechanism to detect if the recipient address is a smart contract.
- Remediation 2: Implement a withdrawal pattern where users can withdraw their Ether instead of pushing it to external addresses. This way, users have control over their funds and can avoid potential loss scenarios.
