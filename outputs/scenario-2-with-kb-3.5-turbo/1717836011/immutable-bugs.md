# Smart contract with Immutable Bugs vulnerability

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ImmutableBug {
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        balance = 0;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balance += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");

    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the above smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the fact that once deployed, the contract's logic and state cannot be modified. This means that if there are any bugs or security vulnerabilities in the contract, they cannot be fixed after deployment, potentially leading to irreversible issues or exploits.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1: Upgradeable Contracts**
  Implement an upgradeable design pattern such as the Proxy pattern. By using a proxy contract to delegate calls to an implementation contract, you can separate the logic from the data storage. This allows for upgrading the implementation contract while keeping the same proxy contract address.

- **Remediation 2: Emergency Escape Hatch**
  Implement an emergency escape hatch mechanism that allows for pausing or stopping critical functions in the contract in case of emergencies. This can provide a way to mitigate potential exploits or bugs by temporarily halting the contract's operations until a fix can be implemented.

By incorporating these remediations, you can enhance the security and flexibility of the smart contract, making it more resilient to vulnerabilities and ensuring that any issues can be addressed in a timely manner.
