# Smart contract with Unexpected Balance Vulnerability

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract EtherGame {
  
  uint256 public targetAmount = 7 ether;
  address public winner;

  function deposit() public payable {
    require(msg.value == 1 ether, "You can only send 1 Ether");

    uint256 balance = address(this).balance; // Vulnerable line
    require(balance <= targetAmount, "Game is over");

    if (balance == targetAmount) {
      winner = msg.sender;
    }
  }

  function claimReward() public {
    // ...
  }
    
}
```

Description of the vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in using `address(this).balance` to check the balance of the smart contract. This can be manipulated by an attacker to send unexpected amounts of Ether to the contract, potentially disrupting the intended behavior of the contract.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Avoid using `address(this).balance` for critical balance checks. Instead, maintain a separate variable to track the total Ether deposited to the contract.
- **Remediation 2:** Implement a deposit tracking mechanism to accurately monitor the Ether deposited by users and prevent unexpected balance manipulation.

By following these remediations, you can mitigate the Unexpected Balance vulnerability and enhance the security of the smart contract.
