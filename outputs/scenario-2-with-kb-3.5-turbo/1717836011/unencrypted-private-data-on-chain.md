# Smart contract

```solidity
contract OddEven {
  
  struct Player {
    address addr;
    uint number;
  }

  Player[2] private players; // Line 10
  uint count = 0;

  function play(uint number) public payable {
    require(msg.value == 1 ether, 'msg.value must be 1 eth');
    players[count] = Player(msg.sender, number);
    count++;
    if (count == 2) selectWinner();
  }

  function selectWinner() private {
    uint n = players[0].number + players[1].number;
    (bool success, ) = players[n%2].addr.call.value(address(this).balance)("");
    require(success, 'transfer failed');

  }
  
}
```

Description of the vulnerability: The vulnerability in the smart contract `OddEven` lies in the fact that the `players` array, which stores the players' addresses and numbers, is marked as `private` but is not encrypted. This means that the data stored in this array is visible on the blockchain and can be easily analyzed by malicious actors to determine the players' choices.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1: Implement Commit-Reveal Scheme**
  - Use a commit-reveal scheme to keep the players' choices private until they are revealed. Players first commit to their choices using a hash function, and then reveal their choices later.
  - Store commitments and blinding factors instead of raw data on the blockchain to prevent front-running attacks.
  - Update the smart contract to include functions for committing, revealing, and determining the winner based on the revealed choices.

- **Remediation 2: Encrypt Private Data Off-Chain**
  - Store sensitive player data off-chain in an encrypted format.
  - Use encryption techniques to protect the players' choices and addresses before storing them on the blockchain.
  - Implement decryption mechanisms within the smart contract to access and process the encrypted data securely.

By implementing these remediations, the smart contract can enhance the privacy and security of the players' data and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.
