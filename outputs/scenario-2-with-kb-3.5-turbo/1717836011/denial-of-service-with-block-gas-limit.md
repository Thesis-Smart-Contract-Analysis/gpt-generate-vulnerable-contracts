# Smart contract

```solidity
// Vulnerable code
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DenialOfService {
    uint[] public data;

    function addData(uint _data) public {
        data.push(_data); // Vulnerable line
    }

    function consumeGas() public {
        for (uint i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            // Some gas-consuming operation
        }
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability: The vulnerable code snippet shows a smart contract that allows adding data to an array using the `addData` function. As the array grows in size, the gas consumption of the `consumeGas` function, which iterates over the array, can exceed the block gas limit, leading to a Denial of Service with Block Gas Limit vulnerability.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1**: Implement a mechanism to limit the gas consumption per transaction. Instead of allowing unbounded growth of the array, consider limiting the number of elements that can be added in a single transaction.

- **Remediation 2**: Implement a paging mechanism where large operations are split into multiple transactions. This approach ensures that gas consumption is spread across multiple blocks, preventing a single transaction from consuming excessive gas.

By applying these remediations, the smart contract can mitigate the Denial of Service with Block Gas Limit vulnerability and ensure the efficient operation of the contract on the Ethereum network.
