# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract AssertRequireVulnerability {
    uint public totalSupply;

    constructor(uint _initialSupply) {
        totalSupply = _initialSupply;
    }

    function updateTotalSupply(uint _newSupply) public {
        totalSupply = _newSupply;
        assert(totalSupply > 0); // Vulnerable line
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability: In the `updateTotalSupply` function, the `assert` statement is used to check if the `totalSupply` is greater than 0 after updating it. However, this assertion can lead to a state-reverting exception if the new supply is 0 or negative, which is not the intended purpose of using `assert`.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Instead of using `assert` for this validation, consider using `require` with a meaningful error message to handle the condition where the new supply is not valid. This way, the transaction will revert gracefully with the provided error message.

- **Remediation 2:** Implement additional checks or validations before updating the `totalSupply` to ensure that the new supply value is valid and meets the contract's requirements. This proactive approach can prevent the need for assert violations.

By applying these remediations, you can enhance the security and reliability of the smart contract by handling exceptional conditions more effectively.
