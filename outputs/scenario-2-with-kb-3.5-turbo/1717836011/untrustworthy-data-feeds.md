# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract PriceFeed {
    address public owner;
    uint public price;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function updatePrice(uint _price) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can update price");
        price = _price;
    }

    function getPrice() public view returns (uint) {
        return price;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the above smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the `updatePrice` function where the price can be manipulated by anyone who calls the function, not just the owner. This allows an attacker to provide false data to the contract, leading to incorrect price updates.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Implement a secure data feed mechanism using a trusted oracle service like Chainlink or Town Crier. These services provide decentralized and tamper-proof data feeds that can be integrated into the smart contract to ensure the reliability of external data.

- **Remediation 2:** Use access control mechanisms such as OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract to restrict the `updatePrice` function only to the contract owner. By doing so, only the owner can update the price, preventing unauthorized manipulation of data feeds.
