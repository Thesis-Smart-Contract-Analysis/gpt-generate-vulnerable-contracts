# Smart contract with Identity Verification vulnerability

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IdentityVerificationVulnerable {
  
  function isContract(address addr) public view returns (bool) {
    uint size;
    assembly { size := extcodesize(addr) }
    return size > 0;
  }
  
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the above smart contract:
The vulnerability lies in the `isContract` function where it checks if the given address is a smart contract by using the `extcodesize` opcode. This method can be bypassed by an attacker by executing code within the constructor, as the `extcodesize` will return 0 during contract creation.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Avoid relying solely on `extcodesize` for identity verification. Consider using additional checks or alternative methods to verify the identity of the caller.
  
- **Remediation 2:** Implement a more robust identity verification mechanism that takes into account potential attack vectors like the one demonstrated in the vulnerability example. Consider using a combination of different factors for verification to enhance security.
