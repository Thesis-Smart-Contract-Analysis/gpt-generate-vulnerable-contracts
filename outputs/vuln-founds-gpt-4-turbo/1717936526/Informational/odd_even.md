### 1. **Use of `call.value()` for Ether Transfer**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The use of `call.value()` for transferring Ether, as seen in the `selectWinner` function, is generally discouraged due to the potential for reentrancy attacks. Although this specific contract does not directly suffer from reentrancy due to the absence of further calls after the Ether transfer, using `call.value()` is less safe compared to `transfer()` or `send()` because it forwards all available gas and does not throw an exception on failure.

**Locations:**

- In the `selectWinner` function:
  ```solidity
  (bool success, ) = players[n%2].addr.call.value(address(this).balance)(""); // Line 19
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Replace `call.value()` with `transfer()` for safer Ether transfers that automatically revert on failure. This change helps in avoiding scenarios where the contract state is manipulated before the transfer completes. The updated line should look like:
```solidity
players[n%2].addr.transfer(address(this).balance);
```

### 2. **Magic Numbers**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract uses a magic number `2` in multiple places, which represents the number of players. Using magic numbers directly in the code can reduce readability and increase the risk of errors if the value needs to be updated or is used in multiple places.

**Locations:**

- In the `play` function:
  ```solidity
  if (count == 2) selectWinner(); // Line 15
  ```

- In the `Player` array declaration:
  ```solidity
  Player[2] private players; // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Define a constant at the contract level to represent the number of players. This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain. For example:
```solidity
uint constant MAX_PLAYERS = 2;
Player[MAX_PLAYERS] private players;
```
And update the condition in the `play` function accordingly:
```solidity
if (count == MAX_PLAYERS) selectWinner();
```

### 3. **Hardcoded Ether Value in `require` Statement**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract expects exactly 1 ether to play the game, as enforced by the `require` statement in the `play` function. This could limit flexibility or future changes in the entry fee.

**Locations:**

- In the `play` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == 1 ether, 'msg.value must be 1 eth'); // Line 13
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider defining the entry fee as a variable or a constant, which could be adjusted more easily than a hardcoded value. This approach increases the contract's adaptability to different circumstances or game rules. For example:
```solidity
uint constant ENTRY_FEE = 1 ether;
require(msg.value == ENTRY_FEE, 'Incorrect entry fee');
```

These changes address the informational severity issues in the contract, enhancing its safety, flexibility, and maintainability.
