### 1. **Predictable Randomness**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract uses a predictable method for generating randomness, which can be exploited by an attacker. The `answer` is determined by hashing the previous block's hash and the current timestamp (`now`). Both of these values can be influenced or anticipated by a miner or observer, making the randomness predictable.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now)); // Line 11
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this issue, consider using a more secure source of randomness. One common approach is to use an oracle to provide a secure random number. Alternatively, commit-reveal schemes can be used to ensure that the answer cannot be determined until all participants have committed their guesses.

### 2. **Unchecked Transfer**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `guess` function transfers ether to the sender if they guess the number correctly, but it does not check the success of the transfer operation. This can lead to unhandled exceptions if the transfer fails (e.g., if the contract does not have enough balance).

**Locations:**

- In the `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(2 ether); // Line 21
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of the `transfer` method or use the `send` method with proper error handling. A safer alternative is to use the `call` method with a specific gas limit and check for success:
```solidity
(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: 2 ether}("");
require(success, "Transfer failed.");
```
This method provides more control and makes the contract more robust against transfer failures.

### 3. **Denial of Service by Griefing**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
If the contract balance is less than 2 ether, and a correct guess is made, the contract will attempt to transfer 2 ether and fail due to insufficient funds. This can be exploited by an attacker who can drain the contract's funds to a level where it's unable to payout, effectively locking all future correct guesses out of their reward.

**Locations:**

- In the `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(2 ether); // Line 21
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement checks to ensure that the contract has sufficient balance before attempting to transfer funds as a reward. Additionally, consider a withdrawal pattern where users withdraw their winnings rather than automatically transferring funds upon a correct guess. This pattern not only mitigates potential DoS attacks but also reduces the risk associated with automatic transfers.

By addressing these vulnerabilities, the contract can be made more secure against potential exploits that could compromise its integrity and the funds it holds.
