### 1. **Predictable Randomness**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract uses `keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now)` to generate a random number. This approach is vulnerable because the values of `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` and `now` (alias for `block.timestamp`) can be predicted by miners or observed by users, making the randomness predictable.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now)); // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this issue, consider using a more secure source of randomness. One approach is to use an oracle service like Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function), which provides secure and verifiable randomness suitable for smart contracts.

### 2. **Unchecked Transfer**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The `guess` function transfers 2 ether to the sender if they guess the number correctly. However, the contract does not check if the transfer was successful. This could potentially lead to unhandled exceptions if the transfer fails.

**Locations:**

- In the `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(2 ether); // Line 20
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Use the `transfer` method's inherent throw on failure, or check the return value of `send` method and ensure proper error handling. Since Solidity 0.4.22, it's recommended to use `require` with the `send` method for better control over error handling:
```solidity
require(msg.sender.send(2 ether));
```

### 3. **Dependence on `blockhash` for Randomness**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract relies on `block.blockhash` for generating randomness. The `blockhash` function only works for the 256 most recent block numbers. For older blocks, it returns zero, which can be predictable and manipulable.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now)); // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Avoid using `block.blockhash` as a sole source of randomness. Combine multiple less predictable data sources, or, as mentioned earlier, use a dedicated randomness oracle like Chainlink VRF.

### 4. **Hardcoded Ether Value in Requirements**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract requires exactly 1 ether to participate in the guessing game (`require(msg.value == 1 ether)`). This can be restrictive and does not allow for any flexibility in participation stakes.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == 1 ether); // Line 8
  ```
- In the `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == 1 ether); // Line 18
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider parameterizing the entry fee or providing different tiers of participation to accommodate various users. This can make the game more accessible and potentially more engaging.

By addressing these vulnerabilities, the contract can be made more secure and functional.
