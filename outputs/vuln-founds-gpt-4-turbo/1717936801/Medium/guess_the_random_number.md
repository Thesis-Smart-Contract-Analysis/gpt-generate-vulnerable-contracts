### 1. **Predictable Randomness**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract uses `keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now)` to generate a random number. This approach is vulnerable because the values used (`block.blockhash` and `now`, which is an alias for `block.timestamp`) are predictable for miners and observers, allowing them to potentially manipulate or predict the outcome to their advantage.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now)); // Line 11
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this issue, consider using a more secure source of randomness. One common approach is to use an oracle to provide a secure random number. Alternatively, commit-reveal schemes can be used to ensure that the randomness cannot be known ahead of time. These methods involve multiple transactions and thus increase complexity but significantly improve security in scenarios where randomness is crucial.

### 2. **Denial of Service by Block Gas Limit**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract's `guess` function sends ether using `msg.sender.transfer(2 ether)`. If `msg.sender` is a contract, and the fallback function of the contract consumes a lot of gas or runs out of gas, it could cause the `transfer` to fail. This can be used as a denial-of-service attack as no further guesses can be processed if the transfer consistently fails.

**Locations:**

- In the `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(2 ether); // Line 21
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Instead of using `transfer`, which forwards 2300 gas and fails on out-of-gas, use `call.value().gas()` with an explicitly set gas amount that is considered safe for the transfer, or better yet, use the withdrawal pattern where users withdraw funds themselves, reducing the risk of denial-of-service attacks against the contract's functionality.

### 3. **Lack of Event Logging**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract does not emit any events. This omission makes it difficult to track interactions via external systems or Ethereum block explorers, which is especially important for functions that involve financial transactions.

**Locations:**

- In the `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(2 ether); // Line 21
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement event logging for key actions within the contract. For example, emit an event when someone makes a guess and when ether is transferred. This not only aids in debugging but also in auditing and tracking contract activity.

### 4. **Hardcoded Ether Value**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract requires exactly 1 ether to play the game and sends exactly 2 ether as a reward. This hardcoded approach lacks flexibility and can lead to issues if the contract does not have enough balance to send 2 ether.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor and `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == 1 ether); // Lines 9 and 18
  msg.sender.transfer(2 ether); // Line 21
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement a more flexible handling of ether values and ensure that the contract checks its balance before attempting to transfer ether. Additionally, consider allowing variable amounts of ether to be bet, with winnings calculated proportionally. This approach can make the game more accessible and reduce the risk of the contract's balance running out.
