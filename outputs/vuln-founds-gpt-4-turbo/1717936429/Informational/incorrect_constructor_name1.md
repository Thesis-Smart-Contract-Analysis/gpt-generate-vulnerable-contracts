### 1. **Incorrect Constructor Name**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
In Solidity, constructors are special functions used for initializing contracts. Before version 0.4.22, constructors were defined using a function with the same name as the contract. However, this approach was error-prone, especially when a contract was renamed but its constructor function was not, leading to a situation where the constructor function would be treated as a regular function that could be called by anyone. In Solidity 0.4.22 and later, a constructor is defined using the `constructor()` keyword, which prevents these issues.

In the provided code, the function intended to be the constructor is named `missing()`, which matches the contract name `Missing`. However, since the Solidity version specified is 0.4.24, the correct way to define a constructor is using the `constructor()` keyword. The current implementation exposes the function `missing()` as a regular public function that can be called by anyone at any time, potentially allowing reinitialization of the contract's state (e.g., changing the owner).

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  function missing() public { // Line 13
      owner = msg.sender;
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this issue, replace the `missing()` function with a proper constructor using the `constructor()` keyword. This change ensures that the initialization code is executed only once when the contract is deployed and cannot be called again thereafter. Here is how you can modify the code:

```solidity
constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
}
```

This change will prevent unauthorized reinitialization of the contract's owner state and adhere to the best practices for Solidity version 0.4.24 and later.
