### 1. **Incorrect Constructor Name**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
In Solidity, constructors are special functions used for initializing contracts. Before version 0.4.22, constructors were defined by creating a function with the same name as the contract. However, this approach was error-prone, especially if the contract name was changed and the constructor function name was not updated accordingly. In Solidity 0.4.22 and later, a constructor keyword is used for constructors to avoid these issues. In the provided contract, the function intended to be the constructor is named `missing`, which matches the contract name `Missing`. However, since the Solidity version is 0.4.24, the correct approach is to use the `constructor` keyword.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  function missing() public { // This should be constructor()
      owner = msg.sender;
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Replace the `missing()` function with a proper constructor using the `constructor` keyword. This change ensures that the function is recognized as a constructor by the Solidity compiler, which is safer and follows the best practices for Solidity version 0.4.24 and later. Here is how you can modify it:
```solidity
constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
}
```
This modification prevents the function from being called post-deployment, which secures the initialization process of the contract.

### 2. **Fallback Function Payable with No Logic**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract includes a fallback function that is marked as `payable` but does not contain any logic. While this is not inherently a security risk, it allows the contract to receive Ether without a clear mechanism for retrieval (other than the `withdraw` function, which is correctly restricted to the owner). This could lead to confusion or misuse in scenarios where the contract is not intended to hold Ether.

**Locations:**

- In the fallback function:
  ```solidity
  function() payable {}
  ```

**Mitigation:**
If the contract is not meant to receive Ether, remove the `payable` keyword from the fallback function to prevent it from accepting Ether transactions. If the contract should accept Ether, consider adding event logging to the fallback function to record incoming transactions for better transparency and traceability:
```solidity
event EtherReceived(address sender, uint amount);

function() payable {
    emit EtherReceived(msg.sender, msg.value);
}
```
This modification helps in tracking Ether sent to the contract and ensures clarity in contract operations.

By addressing these low-severity issues, the contract can adhere to best practices and reduce potential confusion or errors in its operation.
