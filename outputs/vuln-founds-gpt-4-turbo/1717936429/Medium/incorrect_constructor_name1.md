### 1. **Incorrect Constructor Name**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
In Solidity versions prior to 0.4.22, constructors were defined by creating a function with the same name as the contract. However, this can lead to errors if the contract name is changed and the constructor function name is not updated accordingly. From version 0.4.22 onwards, a constructor keyword is used for constructors which prevents this issue. In the provided contract, the function intended to be the constructor is named `missing`, which matches the contract name `Missing`. However, if the contract name is changed, or if there is a typo, this would no longer function as a constructor, potentially leaving the contract without an owner.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  function missing() public { // Line 13
      owner = msg.sender;
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To avoid this issue, use the `constructor()` keyword for defining constructors as recommended in Solidity version 0.4.22 and later. This change ensures that the constructor is clearly defined and is not dependent on the contract's name, thus avoiding potential bugs related to renaming:
```solidity
constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
}
```

### 2. **Unchecked Send**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The `withdraw()` function uses `transfer()` to send Ether, which throws an exception if the send fails. While `transfer()` is generally safer than `send()` because it reverts on failure, it still enforces a fixed gas stipend (2300 gas) which might not be enough if the fallback function of the recipient performs more than basic operations. This can lead to situations where legitimate withdrawals fail because of out-of-gas errors caused by the recipient's fallback function.

**Locations:**

- In the withdraw function:
  ```solidity
  owner.transfer(this.balance); // Line 20
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider handling the possibility of a failed send more gracefully. This can be achieved by using `call.value().gas()` with a higher gas limit and checking the return value, or by implementing a pull payment system where users withdraw funds themselves, reducing the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks due to out-of-gas errors:
```solidity
(bool success, ) = owner.call.value(this.balance).gas(10000)("");
require(success, "Transfer failed.");
```

### 3. **Missing Event Logging**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract does not emit any events. Events are crucial for tracking changes of state on the blockchain in a transparent and external way, especially in functions that change the ownership or balance such as `missing()` and `withdraw()`.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  function missing() public { // Line 13
      owner = msg.sender;
  }
  ```
- In the withdraw function:
  ```solidity
  owner.transfer(this.balance); // Line 20
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Add event declarations and emit events in the constructor and any function that updates the state of the contract. For example:
```solidity
event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);
event Withdrawal(address indexed to, uint amount);

constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
    emit OwnershipTransferred(address(0), msg.sender);
}

function withdraw() public onlyowner {
    emit Withdrawal(owner, this.balance);
    owner.transfer(this.balance);
}
```

These changes will help in monitoring the contract's activities and ensure that important state changes are recorded and observable on the blockchain.
