### 1. **Incorrect Constructor Name**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
In Solidity, constructors are special functions used for initializing contracts. Before version 0.4.22, constructors were defined by creating a function with the same name as the contract. However, this approach was error-prone, especially if the contract name was changed and the constructor function name was not updated accordingly. In Solidity 0.4.22 and later, a constructor keyword is used for constructors to avoid these issues. In the provided contract, the function intended to be the constructor is named `missing`, which matches the contract name `Missing`. However, due to case sensitivity in Solidity (Solidity is case-sensitive), `missing` does not act as a constructor. This results in the `owner` variable not being set upon contract initialization, leaving the contract without an owner. This can lead to unauthorized access or other critical issues since the `owner` check in the `onlyowner` modifier will fail.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  function missing() public { // This should be the constructor
      owner = msg.sender;
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this issue, rename the function `missing()` to `constructor()` using the constructor keyword introduced in Solidity 0.4.22. This change ensures that the function is recognized as a constructor by the Solidity compiler, and it is executed during the contract deployment to correctly initialize the `owner` state variable. Here is how you can modify it:

```solidity
constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
}
```

This modification will ensure that the `owner` is set correctly at the time of contract deployment, securing the contract's sensitive functions that rely on the `owner` state variable.
