### 1. **Hardcoded Prices**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract uses a hardcoded price for tokens (`PRICE_PER_TOKEN = 1 ether`). This can limit flexibility and adaptability of the contract to changing conditions or requirements, such as adjustments in token pricing strategy or ether valuation changes.

**Locations:**

- In the global variable declaration:
  ```solidity
  uint256 constant PRICE_PER_TOKEN = 1 ether; // Line 6
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider implementing a mechanism to adjust the token price dynamically. This could involve governance actions or formulas that adjust prices based on external or internal factors, enhancing the contract's flexibility and responsiveness to market conditions.

### 2. **Constructor Requirements**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The constructor of the contract requires exactly 1 ether to be sent when deploying (`require(msg.value == 1 ether)`). This is restrictive and assumes that the initial conditions must always be set with exactly 1 ether, which may not be necessary or could be an oversight.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == 1 ether); // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Evaluate whether the contract's logic necessarily requires this initial amount. If not, consider removing such constraints or making them configurable through constructor parameters. This would make the deployment of the contract more flexible.

### 3. **Lack of Event Emission on State Change**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract does not emit any events after key state changes such as token purchases or sales. Events are crucial for off-chain applications to react to changes efficiently and for easier tracking and logging of contract activity.

**Locations:**

- After updating balances in `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens; // Line 19
  ```
- After updating balances in `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  balanceOf[msg.sender] -= numTokens; // Line 27
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement event logging for these state changes. Define events such as `TokensPurchased` and `TokensSold`, and emit them appropriately within the `buy` and `sell` functions whenever these actions are performed. This will improve the transparency and auditability of the contract.

### 4. **Fixed Constructor Payable Value**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The constructor of the contract is designed to only accept exactly 1 ether. This design choice restricts the flexibility in terms of initial funding and might not always align with the deployment strategies or initial conditions expected by the deployers.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == 1 ether); // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider parameterizing the initial funding amount or removing such strict requirements if they are not critical to the contract's functionality. This change would allow more flexibility in how the contract is initially funded and used.

By addressing these informational issues, the contract can be made more robust, adaptable, and easier to interact with from both a user and developer perspective.
