### 1. **Hardcoded Prices and Values**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract uses a hardcoded value for `PRICE_PER_TOKEN` which is set to 1 ether. This can limit flexibility and adaptability of the contract in response to changes in the market or token economics. Hardcoding values can also make the contract less adaptable to future requirements or changes in business logic.

**Locations:**

- In the global variable declaration:
  ```solidity
  uint256 constant PRICE_PER_TOKEN = 1 ether; // Line 6
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To increase flexibility, consider making `PRICE_PER_TOKEN` a modifiable state variable rather than a constant. This allows the contract owner or another authorized party to adjust the token price dynamically through a function that includes appropriate access control mechanisms.

### 2. **Constructor Requires Exact Ether Amount**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The constructor of the contract requires exactly 1 ether to be sent when deploying the contract (`require(msg.value == 1 ether)`). This requirement is rigid and might not be clear to users, potentially leading to failed transactions if the exact amount is not sent.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == 1 ether); // Line 9
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider either removing the requirement to send exactly 1 ether or provide clear documentation and error messages indicating the necessity of this exact amount. Alternatively, implementing a refund mechanism for any excess ether sent could also be a user-friendly approach.

### 3. **Lack of Event Emission on Token Transactions**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract does not emit any events upon buying or selling tokens. Events are crucial for off-chain applications to track changes in the state of the contract effectively and in real-time.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens; // Line 18
  ```

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  balanceOf[msg.sender] -= numTokens; // Line 25
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN); // Line 26
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement and emit events such as `TokensPurchased` and `TokensSold` in the `buy` and `sell` functions respectively. This will help in tracking token distribution and sales activities more transparently and efficiently.

### 4. **No Input Validation for `numTokens`**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The functions `buy` and `sell` do not validate if the `numTokens` parameter is greater than zero. This could lead to transactions that do not change the state but still consume gas.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN); // Line 17
  ```

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= numTokens); // Line 23
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Add a requirement to check that `numTokens` is greater than zero in both the `buy` and `sell` functions to prevent unnecessary gas expenditure and to ensure that the functions are called with meaningful input.

These low-severity issues, while not critical, can improve the contract's flexibility, usability, and maintainability if addressed.
