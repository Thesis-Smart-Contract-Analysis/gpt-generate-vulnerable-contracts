### 1. **Hardcoded Address**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract contains hardcoded addresses for both the owner and the recipient in the `withdrawAll` function. Hardcoding addresses can lead to risks such as loss of control over the contract if the private keys of the hardcoded addresses are compromised. Additionally, it reduces the flexibility and upgradability of the contract.

**Locations:**

- Owner address hardcoded:
  ```solidity
  address owner = 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4; // Line 4
  ```
- Recipient address hardcoded in `withdrawAll`:
  ```solidity
  payable(0x617F2E2fD72FD9D5503197092aC168c91465E7f2).transfer(address(this).balance); // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Avoid hardcoding addresses directly in the contract. Instead, use a configuration function that only the owner can call to set these addresses. This approach increases the maintainability and flexibility of the contract. Ensure that proper access control mechanisms are in place to protect these configuration functions.

### 2. **Lack of Event Logging**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract functions `withdrawAll` and `withdraw` transfer Ether but do not emit any events. Events are crucial for tracking the state changes on the blockchain, especially for critical operations like transferring funds. Lack of event logging makes it difficult to observe and verify the contract's behavior externally.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawAll` function:
  ```solidity
  payable(0x617F2E2fD72FD9D5503197092aC168c91465E7f2).transfer(address(this).balance); // Line 10
  ```
- In the `withdraw` function:
  ```solidity
  payable(receiver).transfer(address(this).balance); // Line 16
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement event logging for all critical operations within the contract. Define events such as `FundsWithdrawn` and emit them whenever funds are transferred. This will enhance the transparency and auditability of the contract.

### 3. **Single Point of Failure in Ownership**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract uses a single `owner` address for administrative control, creating a single point of failure. If the owner's private key is compromised, the entire contract is at risk.

**Locations:**

- Owner control defined and used:
  ```solidity
  address owner = 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4; // Line 4
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement a more robust access control mechanism, such as multi-signature control or a decentralized governance model, to reduce the risks associated with a single point of failure. This can be achieved by using more advanced patterns like the use of multisig wallets or implementing a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for critical decision-making processes.

By addressing these low-severity issues, the contract can be made more robust, flexible, and secure against a broader range of potential risks.
