### 1. **Hardcoded Address**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract contains hardcoded addresses for both the owner and the recipient of funds in the `withdrawAll` function. Hardcoding addresses can lead to security risks if the address is compromised. Additionally, it reduces the flexibility and upgradability of the contract, as the address cannot be changed without deploying a new contract.

**Locations:**

- Owner address hardcoded:
  ```solidity
  address owner = 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4; // Line 4
  ```
- Recipient address hardcoded in `withdrawAll`:
  ```solidity
  payable(0x617F2E2fD72FD9D5503197092aC168c91465E7f2).transfer(address(this).balance); // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Avoid hardcoding addresses directly in the contract. Instead, use a constructor or a setter function protected by an appropriate access control mechanism to set these addresses. This approach increases the contract's flexibility and security by allowing address updates without needing to deploy a new contract.

### 2. **Missing Checks on Transfer Success**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `transfer` function is used in the contract to send Ether. If the `transfer` fails (e.g., if the recipient is a contract that does not accept Ether), it throws an exception, but the contract does not have any mechanism to handle such exceptions gracefully. This can lead to denial of service (DoS) if the contract consistently fails to send Ether due to an uncooperative recipient.

**Locations:**

- In `withdrawAll` function:
  ```solidity
  payable(0x617F2E2fD72FD9D5503197092aC168c91465E7f2).transfer(address(this).balance); // Line 10
  ```
- In `withdraw` function:
  ```solidity
  payable(receiver).transfer(address(this).balance); // Line 16
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Replace the `transfer` method with `call` combined with `.value()` and proper error handling. For example:
```solidity
(bool success, ) = payable(receiver).call{value: address(this).balance}("");
require(success, "Transfer failed");
```
This method provides more control over the transaction and allows the contract to handle errors more gracefully.

### 3. **Lack of Event Logging**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract does not emit any events after transferring Ether. Event logs are crucial for tracking the contract's activity and for off-chain applications to monitor changes in contract state effectively.

**Locations:**

- In `withdrawAll` function:
  ```solidity
  payable(0x617F2E2fD72FD9D5503197092aC168c91465E7f2).transfer(address(this).balance); // Line 10
  ```
- In `withdraw` function:
  ```solidity
  payable(receiver).transfer(address(this).balance); // Line 16
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement event logging for critical actions within the contract. Define and emit events for all Ether transfers to help in tracking transactions and debugging issues. For example:
```solidity
event EtherTransferred(address recipient, uint amount);

function withdraw(address receiver) public onlyAdmin {
    uint amount = address(this).balance;
    payable(receiver).transfer(amount);
    emit EtherTransferred(receiver, amount);
}
```
This change will improve the transparency and auditability of the contract.
