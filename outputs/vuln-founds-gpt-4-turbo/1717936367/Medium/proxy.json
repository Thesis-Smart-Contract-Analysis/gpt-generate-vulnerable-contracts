        "content": "### 1. **Delegatecall to Arbitrary Location**\n\n**Severity:**\nMedium\n\n**Description:**\nThe use of `delegatecall` with a user-provided address (`callee`) can lead to severe security vulnerabilities if not properly handled. `delegatecall` is a powerful feature in Solidity that allows a contract to delegate execution to another contract while maintaining its own storage context. This can be exploited by attackers if they can control the address being called. An attacker could potentially manipulate the contract state in unintended ways or execute unintended functions within the context of the calling contract.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `forward` function:\n  ```solidity\n  require(callee.delegatecall(_data)); // Line 10\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate this risk, consider implementing additional checks to ensure that the address being delegated to is trusted. This can be achieved by maintaining a list of approved contracts and checking that `callee` is in this list before performing the `delegatecall`. Alternatively, use a dedicated interface and ensure that the callee adheres to this interface, which would limit the functions that can be called and reduce the surface for potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider setting stricter access controls for functions that involve delegate calls, such as limiting them to only the owner or specific administrators of the contract.",
