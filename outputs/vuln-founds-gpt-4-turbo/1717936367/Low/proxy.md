### 1. **Delegatecall to Arbitrary Location**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The use of `delegatecall` with a user-provided address can lead to unintended behavior or malicious actions if the callee contract contains malicious code. In this contract, the `forward` function allows the sender to specify any address to delegatecall. This can be risky if the callee address is not verified or known to be safe, as it could execute unintended functions or alter the state of the contract in undesirable ways.

**Locations:**

- In the `forward` function:
  ```solidity
  require(callee.delegatecall(_data)); // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this risk, consider implementing a whitelist of approved contracts that can be called via `delegatecall`. This list should be managed by the contract owner or through a decentralized governance process. Additionally, using a proxy pattern with a well-defined upgrade mechanism could help manage which contracts are callable and limit the scope of functions that can be executed via `delegatecall`.
