### 1. **Delegatecall to Arbitrary Location**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `delegatecall` function is used to call a method of another contract, setting the context of the callee to the current contract. This means that the callee can modify the storage of the calling contract. In the provided contract, the `forward` function allows any address specified by the caller to execute code within the context of the `Proxy` contract using `delegatecall`. This can lead to unintended modifications of the contract's state or even malicious actions if an attacker can call `forward` with a crafted input.

**Locations:**

- In the `forward` function:
  ```solidity
  require(callee.delegatecall(_data)); // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, restrict the use of `delegatecall` to only trusted contracts. One approach is to maintain a list of approved contracts and check that the `callee` is in this list before performing the `delegatecall`. Additionally, consider implementing role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can call sensitive functions like `forward`. Here's a brief outline of changes:

- Implement an access control mechanism to restrict who can call the `forward` function.
- Maintain a list of trusted contracts and check against this list before executing `delegatecall`.
- Consider using `OpenZeppelin` contracts for standardized, tested, and community-reviewed implementations of access control and other security features.

These steps will help ensure that only authorized and intended operations are allowed, significantly reducing the risk of malicious contract interactions and unintended state changes.
