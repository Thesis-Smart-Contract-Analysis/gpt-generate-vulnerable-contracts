### 1. **Hardcoded Gas Amount**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
In Solidity, when making external calls using functions like `delegatecall`, it's possible to specify the amount of gas that the callee can use. If the gas amount is not specified, it uses all remaining gas. This can sometimes lead to situations where there is not enough gas left for the rest of the execution if the called contract consumes a lot.

**Locations:**

- In the `forward` function:
  ```solidity
  require(callee.delegatecall(_data)); // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Specify a gas limit when using `delegatecall` to prevent the callee from potentially consuming all gas available to the transaction. This can be done by modifying the call as follows: `callee.delegatecall.gas(gasAmount)(_data)`, where `gasAmount` is the amount of gas you want to allocate to the call.

### 2. **Lack of Event Logging**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract does not emit any events. Events are useful for logging contract activities and changes in state, which can be crucial for debugging and tracking contract behavior on the blockchain.

**Locations:**

- In the `forward` function:
  ```solidity
  require(callee.delegatecall(_data)); // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider emitting events in functions where important state changes occur or where significant actions are taken. For example, after a successful `delegatecall`, an event could be emitted to log the address of the callee and the data sent. This would improve transparency and traceability of the contract's operations.

### 3. **Owner Authentication Missing**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The `forward` function allows any user to make a delegate call to any address with any data. This could be risky if the function is intended to be restricted to the owner or a set of authorized users.

**Locations:**

- In the `forward` function:
  ```solidity
  require(callee.delegatecall(_data)); // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
If the `forward` function is meant to be restricted, implement access control checks. This can be done by adding a modifier that checks if `msg.sender` is equal to the owner or another authorized entity. For example:
```solidity
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Caller is not the owner");
    _;
}
```
Then apply this modifier to the `forward` function:
```solidity
function forward(address callee, bytes _data) public onlyOwner {
    require(callee.delegatecall(_data));
}
```

These informational findings aim to enhance the contract's robustness, security, and usability by addressing potential minor issues before they could impact the system or its users.
