### 1. **Use of tx.origin for Authorization**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The use of `tx.origin` for authorization purposes can lead to security vulnerabilities, particularly in cases where a contract is invoked by another contract. The `tx.origin` variable returns the original sender of the transaction, not the immediate caller, which can be exploited in phishing attacks where a malicious contract tricks a user into executing a transaction.

**Locations:**

- In the `sendTo` function:
  ```solidity
  require(tx.origin == owner); // Line 12
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Replace `tx.origin` with `msg.sender` for authorization checks. `msg.sender` is the immediate caller of the function, which is more secure for access control in contracts. This change prevents attacks where the contract is called by another contract under deceptive circumstances.

### 2. **Constructor Naming**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
In Solidity versions prior to 0.4.22, constructors were defined using a function with the same name as the contract. This can lead to issues where the constructor function might not be recognized as a constructor if the contract name is changed, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- Constructor definition:
  ```solidity
  function MyContract() public { // Line 8
      owner = msg.sender;
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Use the `constructor()` keyword for defining constructors to avoid issues related to naming conventions and to ensure clarity and security, especially in future upgrades or modifications of the contract. This is supported in Solidity 0.4.22 and later versions.

### 3. **Explicit Visibility in Constructor**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The constructor function `MyContract()` does not explicitly declare its visibility. In Solidity, it is best practice to explicitly declare function visibility to avoid confusion and potential errors in contract behavior.

**Locations:**

- Constructor definition:
  ```solidity
  function MyContract() public { // Line 8
      owner = msg.sender;
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Although the default visibility for constructors is `public`, it is recommended to explicitly specify the visibility of constructors to improve code readability and maintainability. Modify the constructor definition to include the `public` visibility keyword explicitly.

### 4. **Sending Ether**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The function `sendTo` uses the `.transfer()` method to send Ether. While `.transfer()` is safe as it reverts on failure, it forwards a fixed amount of gas (2300 gas) which might not be sufficient for all types of transactions or in future changes of the Ethereum platform.

**Locations:**

- In the `sendTo` function:
  ```solidity
  receiver.transfer(amount); // Line 13
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider using `.send()` with proper error handling, or `call.value()` with a reentrancy guard for more flexibility in gas forwarding. This approach provides better control over the transaction, especially in cases where more complex operations need to be performed in the fallback function of the receiver.
