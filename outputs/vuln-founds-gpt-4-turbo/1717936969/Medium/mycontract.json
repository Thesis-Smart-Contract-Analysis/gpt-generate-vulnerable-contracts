If a contract calls another contract, which then calls this contract, `tx.origin` will still refer to the initial external caller, not the immediate caller (`msg.sender`). Malicious contracts can exploit this by tricking users into interacting with them, which then call the vulnerable contract, passing the `tx.origin` check if the user is the owner.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `sendTo` function:\n  ```solidity\n  require(tx.origin == owner); // Line 12\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nReplace `tx.origin` with `msg.sender` for authorization checks. `msg.sender` refers to the immediate caller of the function, which is more secure for access control. This change ensures that only the direct caller, who must be the owner, can execute sensitive functions. Here's how you can modify the code:\n\n```solidity\nrequire(msg.sender == owner);\n```\n\nThis modification will prevent attackers from exploiting the contract through a phishing attack, as they would need to control the direct calling account, not just any account in the transaction chain.",
