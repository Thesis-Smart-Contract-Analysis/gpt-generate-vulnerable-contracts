### 1. **Unchecked Low-Level Call**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
In Solidity, low-level calls such as `call()`, `delegatecall()`, and `send()` do not throw an exception if the call fails, but instead return a boolean value indicating success or failure. Failing to check this return value can lead to unexpected behaviors and vulnerabilities, particularly in cases where the success of the subsequent logic depends on the successful execution of the call. This can lead to issues where a call to a malicious contract could fail silently, but the calling contract continues execution as if it succeeded, potentially leading to security risks such as loss of funds or incorrect state changes.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call(); // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of the `call()` function. If the function is expected to succeed as a precondition for subsequent steps, use `require()` to assert successful execution. For example, modify the `callnotchecked` function to:
```solidity
require(callee.call(), "Call failed");
```
This change ensures that the function will revert if the call fails, preventing any further execution and state changes that depend on the success of the call.
