### 1. **Unchecked Low-Level Call**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
In Solidity, low-level calls such as `call()`, `delegatecall()`, and `send()` return a boolean value indicating success or failure. It is crucial to check this return value to ensure that the call did not fail silently. Ignoring the return value can lead to unexpected behaviors and vulnerabilities in the contract, especially if the callee is expected to perform critical logic.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call(); // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of the low-level call functions. Use `require()` to assert successful execution. If the call is expected to fail under normal circumstances, handle the failure case appropriately to ensure that the contract remains in a valid state. For example:
```solidity
require(callee.call(), "Call failed");
```
This change ensures that the contract reacts appropriately to the failure of the callee, preventing silent failures and potential logical errors in the contract's execution.

### 2. **Outdated Compiler Version**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract is compiled with Solidity version 0.4.25, which is significantly outdated. Using older compiler versions can expose the contract to known bugs and vulnerabilities that have been fixed in later versions. Additionally, newer compiler versions often include optimizations and new language features that can improve the security and efficiency of the contract.

**Locations:**

- At the beginning of the contract:
  ```solidity
  pragma solidity 0.4.25;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Upgrade the compiler version to the latest stable release. Before upgrading, thoroughly test the contract to ensure that changes in compiler behavior do not introduce new issues. Consider using automated tools and audits to detect potential migration issues. Update the pragma statement to:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```
or the latest version available. Make sure to review and adjust the contract code to comply with breaking changes introduced in newer versions of the compiler.

### 3. **Lack of Function Visibility Specified**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The functions `callchecked` and `callnotchecked` do not explicitly specify their visibility. In Solidity, functions are `public` by default, but it is considered good practice to explicitly declare function visibility to improve code readability and maintainability.

**Locations:**

- `callchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  function callchecked(address callee) public {
  ```

- `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  function callnotchecked(address callee) public {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Explicitly declare the visibility of functions. This makes the contract easier to understand and maintain, as it is clear whether the functions are intended to be called externally or only within the contract. Modify the function declarations to include the `public` keyword explicitly:
```solidity
function callchecked(address callee) public {
```
```solidity
function callnotchecked(address callee) public {
```
This change clarifies the intended use of these functions and helps prevent accidental changes in visibility during future maintenance.
