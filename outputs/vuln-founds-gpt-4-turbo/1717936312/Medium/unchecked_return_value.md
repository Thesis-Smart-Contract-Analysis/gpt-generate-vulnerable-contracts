### 1. **Unchecked External Call**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
In Solidity, making an external call without checking the return value can lead to unexpected behavior. If the called contract fails or the call itself reverts for any reason, the current contract will not be aware, and execution will continue as if the call had succeeded. This can lead to state inconsistencies and errors in the logic of the contract.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call(); // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of the `.call()` function. This can be done using `require()` to ensure that if the call fails, the entire transaction is reverted. Here is how you can modify the `callnotchecked` function:

```solidity
require(callee.call(), "External call failed");
```

This change ensures that if the external call fails, the transaction is reverted, and an error message is provided for easier debugging and safer contract behavior.
