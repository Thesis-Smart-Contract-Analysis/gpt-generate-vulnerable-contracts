### 1. **Unchecked Low-Level Call**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
In Solidity, low-level calls such as `call()`, `delegatecall()`, and `send()` return a boolean value indicating success or failure. Failing to check this return value can lead to unexpected behaviors if the call fails but the contract continues execution as if it succeeded. This can be particularly dangerous if the call's success is critical to the subsequent logic.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call(); // Line 10
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of the low-level calls. If the function's execution depends on the success of the call, use `require()` to ensure that the call was successful. For example, modify the `callnotchecked` function to include a check like this:
```solidity
require(callee.call(), "Call failed");
```
This change ensures that the function will revert if the call fails, preventing any further execution and state changes that depend on the success of the call.
