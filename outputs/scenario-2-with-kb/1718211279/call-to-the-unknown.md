# Smart Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CallToUnknown {
    function transferEther(address payable _to) public payable {
        // Call to the unknown vulnerability
        (bool sent, ) = _to.call{value: msg.value}(""); // line 7
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
}

```

The vulnerability in the above smart contract lies in line 7, where a low-level `call` is used without specifying the function to be called. This can lead to unintended behavior if the destination address `_to` is a contract that has a fallback or receive function defined. The `call` will execute that function, potentially leading to reentrancy attacks or other unexpected behavior.

# Remediations

1. **Specify Function Signature**: Always specify the function signature when making external calls to ensure that the correct function is being called. For example, if you intend to call a `receiveEther` function in the recipient contract, modify the call as follows:
   ```solidity
   (bool sent, ) = _to.call{value: msg.value}(abi.encodeWithSignature("receiveEther()"));
   ```

2. **Use Higher-Level Functions**: Instead of using low-level calls like `call`, prefer using higher-level functions such as `transfer` or `send` when the goal is simply to transfer Ether. These functions have built-in reentrancy protection by limiting the gas sent along with the Ether:
   ```solidity
   _to.transfer(msg.value);
   ```
   Note that `transfer` throws an error if the transfer fails, while `send` returns a boolean value.

3. **Implement Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: Ensure that interactions with other contracts occur after all checks and effects. This pattern minimizes the risk of reentrancy:
   ```solidity
   function safeTransferEther(address payable _to) public payable {
       require(msg.value > 0, "Send some ether");
       
       // Effect
       uint256 balanceBeforeTransfer = address(this).balance;

       // Interaction
       _to.transfer(msg.value);

       // Check
       assert(address(this).balance == balanceBeforeTransfer - msg.value);
   }
   ```

4. **Reentrancy Guard**: Use a reentrancy guard modifier to prevent recursive calls:
   ```solidity
   bool private locked = false;

   modifier noReentrancy() {
       require(!locked, "No reentrancy");
       locked = true;
       _;
       locked = false;
   }

   function transferEtherWithGuard(address payable _to) public payable noReentrancy {
       _to.transfer(msg.value);
   }
   ```

By implementing these remediations, the smart contract can be made more secure against the Call to the Unknown vulnerability and other related security risks.
