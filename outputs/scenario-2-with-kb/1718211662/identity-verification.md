# Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract IdentityVerification {

    address public owner;

    function IdentityVerification() public {
        owner = msg.sender; // line 6
    }

    function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner); // line 10
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
}
```

The vulnerability in this smart contract lies in the constructor function. In Solidity versions prior to 0.4.22, constructors are defined using the function name that matches the contract name. However, this approach is error-prone because renaming the contract does not automatically rename the constructor, which can lead to the deployment of a contract without a proper constructor. This can leave the contract without an initialized owner, making the `changeOwner` function accessible to anyone.

# Remediations

1. **Use the `constructor` Keyword**: Starting from Solidity version 0.4.22, it is recommended to define constructors using the `constructor` keyword. This approach is less error-prone and makes the code clearer.

    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

    contract IdentityVerification {
        address public owner;

        constructor() public {
            owner = msg.sender;
        }

        function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
            require(msg.sender == owner);
            owner = _newOwner;
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Version Control and Auditing**: Ensure that the smart contract code is thoroughly audited by experienced developers or auditors, especially when upgrading the Solidity compiler version or making significant changes to the contract structure. Use version control systems to track changes and maintain the history of modifications.

3. **Educate Developers**: Provide training and resources to developers about the importance of using the correct constructor syntax and the potential risks associated with using outdated or deprecated features in Solidity. Encourage best practices and continuous learning to keep up with the latest security standards and recommendations in smart contract development.
