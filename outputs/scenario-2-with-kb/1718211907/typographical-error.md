# Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

## Description of the Vulnerability

In the above smart contract, the `_sendWinnings` function is vulnerable due to its default visibility. Since no explicit visibility is defined, it defaults to `public`, meaning it can be called by anyone. This allows any user to directly invoke `_sendWinnings` and potentially withdraw all the contract's balance without meeting the intended condition in `withdrawWinnings`.

# Remediations

1. **Set Explicit Visibility for Functions**: Always declare function visibility explicitly to avoid unintended exposure. For internal logic that should not be accessible outside the contract, use `internal` or `private` visibility.

   ```solidity
   function _sendWinnings() internal {
       msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
   }
   ```

2. **Upgrade Solidity Version**: Use a newer version of Solidity (at least `^0.5.0`) where it is mandatory to specify function visibility, reducing the risk of such errors.

   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

   contract HashForEther {
       function withdrawWinnings() public {
           require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
           _sendWinnings();
       }
       
       function _sendWinnings() internal {
           msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
       }
   }
   ```

By implementing these remediations, the contract's functions are better protected against unauthorized access, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
