# Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TypoExample {
    uint public count = 0;

    function increment() public {
        count =+ 1; // line number in smart contract: 7
    }

    function getCount() public view returns (uint) {
        return count;
    }
}
```

The vulnerability in the above smart contract is a Typographical Error in line 7. The operator `=+` is used instead of `+=`, which results in the variable `count` being set to 1 instead of being incremented by 1.

# Remediations

1. **Correct the Typographical Error:**
   Change `count =+ 1;` to `count += 1;` to ensure the `count` variable is incremented by 1 instead of being set to 1.

   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   contract TypoExample {
       uint public count = 0;

       function increment() public {
           count += 1; // Corrected line
       }

       function getCount() public view returns (uint) {
           return count;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Review and Test Code:**
   Always thoroughly review and test your code to catch and correct typographical errors before deploying smart contracts. Automated tests can help ensure that your smart contract behaves as expected.

By addressing these remediations, you can prevent unintended behavior in your smart contracts due to typographical errors.
