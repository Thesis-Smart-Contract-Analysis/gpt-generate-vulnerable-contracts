# Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

## Description of the Vulnerability

In the above smart contract, the function `_sendWinnings()` is vulnerable due to its default visibility. Since no explicit visibility is set, it defaults to `public`, meaning that anyone can call `_sendWinnings()` directly, bypassing the `withdrawWinnings()` checks and potentially allowing unauthorized users to withdraw all the contract's Ether.

# Remediations

1. **Set Explicit Visibility for Functions**: Always declare function visibility explicitly to avoid unintended exposure. For internal logic that should not be accessible externally, use `internal` or `private` visibility.

2. **Use Modifiers for Access Control**: Implement modifiers to check conditions before executing function logic, ensuring that functions are called in the correct context and by authorized users.

Here's the revised version of the smart contract implementing these remediations:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {
  
  function withdrawWinnings() public {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0.
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() internal {
     msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }

}
```

In this revised contract, `_sendWinnings()` is marked as `internal`, preventing it from being called directly by external entities. This ensures that Ether can only be withdrawn through the `withdrawWinnings()` function, which includes the necessary checks.
