# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract IdentityVerification {

  function checkIfContract(address addr) public returns (bool) {
    uint size;
    assembly { size := extcodesize(addr) } // Vulnerable line
    return size > 0;
  }

  function performAction() public {
    require(!checkIfContract(msg.sender), "Contracts are not allowed");
    // perform some action
  }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the above smart contract:
The `checkIfContract` function checks if an address is a contract by using the `extcodesize` opcode. However, this check is ineffective during contract construction, as the size will be zero until the contract's constructor finishes execution. Therefore, a contract can call `performAction` from its constructor and bypass the check.

# Remediations

1. **Use `tx.origin` for verification:**
   Replace the check with `tx.origin`, which cannot be a contract during the execution of a transaction.
   
   ```solidity
   function performAction() public {
       require(tx.origin == msg.sender, "Contracts are not allowed");
       // perform some action
   }
   ```

2. **Implement a multi-step verification process:**
   Instead of relying solely on `extcodesize`, implement additional logic to verify the identity and intent of the caller.
   
   ```solidity
   contract IdentityVerification {

       mapping(address => bool) public verifiedHumans;

       function register() public {
           require(tx.origin == msg.sender, "Contracts are not allowed");
           verifiedHumans[msg.sender] = true;
       }

       function performAction() public {
           require(verifiedHumans[msg.sender], "Address not verified as human");
           // perform some action
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Utilize more secure identity verification mechanisms:**
   Consider using identity verification services or protocols that provide stronger guarantees about the identity of the caller.
