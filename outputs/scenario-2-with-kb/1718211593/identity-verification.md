# Smart Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IdentityVerification {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender; // line 6
    }

    function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the current owner can change ownership.");
        owner = _newOwner; // line 10
    }
}
```

The vulnerability in this smart contract lies in the visibility of the `owner` state variable. Although it is declared as `public`, which automatically generates a getter function, the critical aspect here is the lack of explicit visibility for the `changeOwner` function. By default, functions are `public` in Solidity versions before 0.5.0, meaning anyone can call `changeOwner` to potentially change the ownership if they can manipulate the transaction sender address (`msg.sender`).

# Remediations

1. **Explicit Function Visibility**: Always declare function visibility explicitly to avoid unintended exposure of function calls. For the `changeOwner` function, it should be explicitly marked as `public` or better yet, `external` if it's only called externally, which is more gas efficient.

    ```solidity
    function changeOwner(address _newOwner) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the current owner can change ownership.");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
    ```

2. **Use of Modifiers for Role Management**: Implement a modifier to handle role-based access control more cleanly and reusably. This approach reduces the risk of forgetting to include access control checks when functions are added or modified.

    ```solidity
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the current owner can perform this action.");
        _;
    }

    function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public onlyOwner {
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
    ```

3. **Upgrade to a Safer Solidity Version**: Consider upgrading to Solidity version 0.5.0 or later, where function visibility must be explicitly stated, reducing the risk of accidental public exposure of functions meant to be restricted.

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    contract IdentityVerification {
        address private owner;

        constructor() {
            owner = msg.sender;
        }

        function changeOwner(address _newOwner) external onlyOwner {
            owner = _newOwner;
        }

        modifier onlyOwner() {
            require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the current owner can perform this action.");
            _;
        }
    }
    ```

By implementing these remediations, the smart contract's security posture is significantly enhanced, protecting against unauthorized access and ensuring that critical functionalities are exposed only to intended users.
