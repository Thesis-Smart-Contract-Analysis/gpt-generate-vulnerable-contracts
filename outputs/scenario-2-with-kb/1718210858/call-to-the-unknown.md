# Smart Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

    function withdrawWinnings() public {  // Vulnerable line
        // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
        require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
        _sendWinnings();
    }
  
    function _sendWinnings() internal {
        msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
    }
     
}
```

The vulnerability in the above smart contract lies in the `withdrawWinnings` function. The function `_sendWinnings` is intended to be an internal function that should only be called by `withdrawWinnings`. However, because `_sendWinnings` is not explicitly marked as `internal`, it defaults to `public` visibility due to Solidity's rules in version 0.4.24. This means that `_sendWinnings` can be called by anyone, not just from within `withdrawWinnings`, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as draining the contract's balance.

# Remediations

1. **Explicit Visibility Declaration**: Always declare function visibility explicitly to avoid unintended access. For the `_sendWinnings` function, it should be declared as `internal` to ensure that it can only be called by other functions within the contract and not externally.

    ```solidity
    function _sendWinnings() internal {
        msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
    }
    ```

2. **Update Solidity Version**: Consider updating the Solidity compiler version to 0.5.0 or later where it is mandatory to specify the visibility of functions. This helps in avoiding the default `public` visibility, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.

    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

    contract HashForEther {
        // Updated contract code with explicit visibility and newer Solidity version
    }
    ```

By implementing these remediations, the contract will be more secure against unintended access and manipulation, protecting the functions as intended by the original design.
