# Smart contract

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ImmutableBugExample {
    address public immutable owner;
    uint256 public immutable creationTime;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender; // Vulnerability on line 8
        creationTime = block.timestamp; // Vulnerability on line 9
    }

    function getOwner() public view returns (address) {
        return owner;
    }

    function getCreationTime() public view returns (uint256) {
        return creationTime;
    }
}
```

The vulnerabilities in the above smart contract stem from the use of the `immutable` keyword on lines 8 and 9. The `immutable` keyword is used to set variables that can only be assigned once and are supposed to remain constant for the lifetime of the contract. However, this can lead to an "Immutable Bugs" vulnerability if the variables are set based on user input or external data during contract deployment, as they cannot be changed later. If there is an error or malicious input at the time of contract deployment, it could lead to unintended behavior.

# Remediations

1. **Validate Inputs Before Assignment**:
   Ensure that any input values used to set `immutable` variables are validated before assignment.

2. **Use Constants Where Possible**:
   If the values assigned to `immutable` variables are known beforehand and do not depend on user input, use `constant` instead of `immutable`.

3. **Limit User Interaction During Deployment**:
   Reduce reliance on user input during contract deployment, and use pre-defined values wherever possible to avoid potential errors or malicious input.

By following these remediation steps, the potential for vulnerabilities related to immutable variables can be significantly reduced.
