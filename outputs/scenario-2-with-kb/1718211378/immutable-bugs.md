# Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() { // line 10
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

The vulnerability in the above smart contract lies in the `_sendWinnings` function. This function is intended to be a private helper function to send winnings to the winner. However, it is not explicitly marked as `internal` or `private`, making it accessible to anyone. This means that any user can directly call `_sendWinnings` to transfer all the contract's balance to their address, bypassing the intended logic in `withdrawWinnings`.

# Remediations

1. **Set Explicit Visibility for Functions**: Ensure that all functions in the smart contract have an explicit visibility specifier. For the `_sendWinnings` function, it should be marked as `internal` to prevent external access, ensuring that it can only be called by other functions within the contract.

   ```solidity
   function _sendWinnings() internal {
       msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
   }
   ```

2. **Use Modifiers for Access Control**: Implement custom modifiers to control the access to sensitive functions. For example, you could create a modifier that checks whether the caller is the intended recipient of the winnings before allowing the execution of `_sendWinnings`.

   ```solidity
   modifier onlyWinner() {
       require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0, "Not the winner");
       _;
   }

   function _sendWinnings() internal onlyWinner {
       msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
   }
   ```

By applying these remediations, the smart contract will be more secure against unauthorized access and manipulation, ensuring that only eligible parties can execute certain functions.
