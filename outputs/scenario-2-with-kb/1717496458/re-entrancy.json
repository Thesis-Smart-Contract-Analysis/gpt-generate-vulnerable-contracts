The vulnerability arises because the contract sends Ether to an external address with `msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\")` before updating the sender's balance. This ordering allows a malicious contract to re-enter the `withdraw` function and potentially withdraw more Ether than the balance if the external contract calls back into `withdraw` during the execution of `msg.sender.call`.\n\n# Remediations\n\n1. **Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: To mitigate re-entrancy attacks, modify the `withdraw` function to follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. This involves performing all checks first, making all effects (state changes), and only then interacting with other contracts.\n\n    ```solidity\n    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) public {\n        uint256 balance = balances[msg.sender];\n        require(balance >= _amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n\n        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount; // State change before external call\n\n        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");\n        require(sent, \"Failed to send Ether\");\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. **Use Reentrancy Guard**: Implement a reentrancy guard to prevent nested (re-entrant) calls to sensitive functions. This can be achieved by using a state variable that locks the contract during the execution of a function.\n\n    ```solidity\n    bool private locked = false;\n\n    modifier noReentrant() {\n        require(!locked, \"No re-entrancy\");\n        locked = true;\n        _;\n        locked = false;\n    }\n\n    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) public noReentrant {\n        uint256 balance = balances[msg.sender];\n        require(balance >= _amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n\n        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;\n\n        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(\"\");\n        require(sent, \"Failed to send Ether\");\n    }\n    ```\n\nBy applying these remediations, the contract can be protected against re-entrancy attacks, ensuring that the state updates are secured before any external interactions that could lead to unexpected re-entries.",
