# Smart Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract AccessControl {
    address public owner;
    uint public secretValue;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender; // line 6
        secretValue = 42;
    }

    function updateSecretValue(uint newValue) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
        secretValue = newValue;
    }

    function getSecretValue() public view returns (uint) {
        return secretValue;
    }
}
```

The vulnerability in this smart contract lies in the visibility of the `owner` state variable. It is declared as `public` on line 6, which automatically generates a getter function. This means that the `owner` address is visible to everyone, which could potentially help malicious entities in targeting attacks or in understanding the access control mechanism.

# Remediations

1. **Change Visibility of Sensitive Data**: The `owner` variable should be set to `private` to prevent automatic generation of a public getter function. This limits the visibility of the `owner` address to within the contract itself, enhancing security by obscurity.

    ```solidity
    address private owner;
    ```

2. **Use Access Control Libraries**: Utilize well-tested libraries such as OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract for managing ownership and access controls. This not only simplifies the code but also reduces the risk of vulnerabilities due to less tested custom implementations.

    ```solidity
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

    contract AccessControl is Ownable {
        uint public secretValue;

        constructor() {
            secretValue = 42;
        }

        function updateSecretValue(uint newValue) public onlyOwner {
            secretValue = newValue;
        }

        function getSecretValue() public view returns (uint) {
            return secretValue;
        }
    }
    ```

By implementing these remediations, the contract can avoid unintended exposure of sensitive information and leverage community-audited code to manage access controls more securely.
