# Smart Contract

contract GasLimitDoS {
    uint public count = 0;

    function increment(uint[] calldata numbers) public {
        for (uint i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            count += numbers[i];
        }
    }
}
```

## Description of the Vulnerability

The function `increment` in the above smart contract is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the block gas limit. The function takes an array of integers as input and iterates over each element to add it to a state variable `count`. If an attacker sends a very large array, the transaction could consume an excessive amount of gas, potentially reaching the block gas limit. This could prevent the transaction from being processed, effectively denying service. Additionally, legitimate transactions might also be blocked or delayed due to the high gas consumption.

# Remediations

1. **Limit the Array Size**: One way to mitigate this vulnerability is to limit the size of the input array. By setting a maximum length for the array, you can ensure that the function does not consume an excessive amount of gas.

    ```solidity
    function increment(uint[] calldata numbers) public {
        require(numbers.length <= 100, "Input array too large");
        for (uint i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            count += numbers[i];
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Paginate Function Calls**: Instead of processing the entire array at once, you can modify the function to process chunks of the array over multiple transactions. This approach spreads the gas cost over several transactions and prevents any single call from consuming too much gas.

    ```solidity
    uint public currentIndex = 0;

    function increment(uint[] calldata numbers, uint batchSize) public {
        uint endIndex = currentIndex + batchSize;
        if (endIndex > numbers.length) endIndex = numbers.length;

        for (uint i = currentIndex; i < endIndex; i++) {
            count += numbers[i];
        }

        currentIndex = endIndex;
        if (currentIndex >= numbers.length) {
            currentIndex = 0; // Reset for next full iteration
        }
    }
    ```

By implementing these remediations, you can protect the smart contract from potential DoS attacks related to the block gas limit and ensure smoother operation even under high load.
