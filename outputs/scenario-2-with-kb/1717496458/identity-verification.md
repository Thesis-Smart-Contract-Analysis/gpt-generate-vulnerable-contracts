# Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() {  // line 5
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {  // line 10
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

## Description of the Vulnerability

The vulnerability in the above smart contract lies in the visibility of the `_sendWinnings()` function. By default, the visibility of functions in Solidity is `public` if not explicitly stated. This means that the `_sendWinnings()` function can be called by anyone, not just internally from within the contract itself. This could lead to unauthorized withdrawals from the contract if an attacker calls this function directly.

# Remediations

1. **Explicitly Declare Function Visibility:**
   - The `_sendWinnings()` function should be declared as `internal` to ensure that it can only be called by other functions within the same contract and not externally. This prevents unauthorized access to the function.

   ```solidity
   function _sendWinnings() internal {
       msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
   }
   ```

2. **Upgrade Solidity Version:**
   - Consider upgrading the Solidity compiler version to `0.5.0` or later. Starting from version `0.5.0`, Solidity requires explicit declaration of function visibility. This helps avoid unintentional errors related to function visibility that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

   contract HashForEther {
       function withdrawWinnings() public {
           require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
           _sendWinnings();
       }
       
       function _sendWinnings() internal {
           msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
       }
   }
   ```

By implementing these remediations, the contract will be protected against unauthorized access to critical functions that manage the transfer of Ether, thereby enhancing the security of the contract.
