# Smart Contract with Double Constructor Vulnerability

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract DoubleConstructor {
    address public owner;

    // First constructor
    function DoubleConstructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Second constructor
    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}
```

### Description of the Vulnerability
In the above smart contract, there is a Double Constructor vulnerability. This contract defines two constructors: one using the old syntax where the constructor function has the same name as the contract (`DoubleConstructor()`), and another using the new `constructor()` syntax introduced in Solidity 0.4.22. This can lead to confusion and inconsistency in contract behavior, as only one constructor should exist in a contract. Depending on the compiler version and settings, one of these constructors might not be recognized, leading to potential deployment issues or unexpected behavior.

# Remediations

1. **Use a Single Constructor Syntax**: To fix this issue, you should use only the new `constructor()` syntax, which is clearer and less error-prone. This ensures that the contract is compatible with Solidity versions 0.4.22 and later, where the constructor syntax was standardized.

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

    contract FixedDoubleConstructor {
        address public owner;

        constructor() public {
            owner = msg.sender;
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Version Control and Comments**: Ensure that the Solidity version is clearly specified at the beginning of the contract using the `pragma solidity` statement. Additionally, adding comments to explain the purpose of the constructor and any changes can help maintain clarity and prevent similar issues in future modifications.

3. **Contract Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing for the smart contract to ensure that the constructor sets the state variables as expected. Use development frameworks like Truffle or Hardhat to write and run tests that check the contract's deployment and initialization logic.

By applying these remediations, the smart contract can be secured against the Double Constructor vulnerability, ensuring that it behaves as expected upon deployment and during its lifecycle.
