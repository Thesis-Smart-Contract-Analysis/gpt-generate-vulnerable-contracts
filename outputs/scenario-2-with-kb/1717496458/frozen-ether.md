# Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract FrozenEther {
    // Funds can be sent to the contract
    function deposit() public payable {}

    // There is no function to withdraw the funds
}
```

The vulnerability in the above smart contract is that it allows depositing Ether but does not provide any function to withdraw it, leading to Ether being permanently locked within the contract.

# Remediations

1. **Implement Withdrawal Function**: Add a function to allow the withdrawal of Ether from the contract. This function should include access control to ensure that only authorized users can withdraw funds.

```solidity
function withdraw(uint amount) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw funds");
    msg.sender.transfer(amount);
}
```

2. **Use Modifiers for Access Control**: Implement modifiers to handle access control more cleanly. This helps in managing who can call sensitive functions like withdrawals.

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can call this function");
    _;
}

function withdraw(uint amount) public onlyOwner {
    msg.sender.transfer(amount);
}
```

3. **Event Logging**: Add event logging to track when funds are deposited or withdrawn. This increases transparency and allows for easier tracking and verification of transactions.

```solidity
event Deposit(address indexed sender, uint amount);
event Withdrawal(address indexed receiver, uint amount);

function deposit() public payable {
    emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
}

function withdraw(uint amount) public onlyOwner {
    msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

By implementing these remediations, the contract will not only allow the withdrawal of funds but also ensure that such actions are secure and transparent.
