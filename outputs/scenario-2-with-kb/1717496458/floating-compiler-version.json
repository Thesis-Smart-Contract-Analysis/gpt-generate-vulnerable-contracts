This allows the contract to be compiled with any compiler version from 0.4.0 to less than 0.6.0. Using a wide range of compiler versions can lead to unexpected behavior due to differences in compiler rules and optimizations over versions.\n\n# Remediations\n\n1. **Fix the Compiler Version**: Specify a fixed compiler version to ensure that the contract behaves consistently across all deployments. This mitigates the risk associated with changes in compiler behavior. For example:\n   ```solidity\n   pragma solidity 0.5.17;\n   ```\n   This ensures that the contract is compiled with Solidity version 0.5.17, which is known and stable.\n\n2. **Regularly Update and Test**: Regularly update the contract to a newer and stable compiler version after thorough testing. This helps in leveraging improvements and security patches in newer compiler versions.\n\nBy addressing the floating compiler version issue, the contract's behavior can be made predictable and secure, adhering to a specific compiler version's rules and optimizations.",
