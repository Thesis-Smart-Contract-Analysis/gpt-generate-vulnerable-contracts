# Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24; // line 1

contract HashForEther {
  
  function withdrawWinnings() public { // line 4
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0.
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() internal { // line 9
     msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }

}
```

The vulnerability in the above smart contract is due to the use of an outdated compiler version specified on line 1. Using an outdated compiler can expose the contract to known bugs and security issues that have been fixed in later versions.

# Remediations

1. **Update Compiler Version**: Upgrade the pragma directive to use a more recent and supported version of the Solidity compiler. This helps in leveraging the latest security patches and language improvements. For example:
   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
   ```
   Ensure that the rest of the code is compatible with the new compiler version and make necessary adjustments.

2. **Explicitly State Function Visibility**: As of Solidity 0.5.0, it is mandatory to explicitly declare the visibility of functions. The `withdrawWinnings` function should explicitly declare its visibility to avoid ambiguity and potential security risks:
   ```solidity
   function withdrawWinnings() public {
       require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
       _sendWinnings();
   }
   ```

3. **Regularly Audit and Update**: Regularly audit the smart contract code with the help of automated tools and by security experts to identify and rectify vulnerabilities that may arise from outdated practices or newly discovered security flaws in the Solidity language or the Ethereum platform.
