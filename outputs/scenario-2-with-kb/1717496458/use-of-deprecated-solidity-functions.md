### Description of the Vulnerability in the Above Smart Contract

The smart contract `DeprecatedSimple` uses several deprecated Solidity features and functions that are either unsafe or have been removed in later versions of Solidity:

1. **Deprecated Constructor (line 3):** The constructor function is named after the contract, which is a pattern deprecated in favor of the `constructor()` syntax introduced in Solidity 0.4.22.
2. **Deprecated Keywords and Functions:**
   - `constant` (line 6): Replaced by `view` and `pure` in Solidity 0.4.17 for better clarity on function mutability.
   - `block.blockhash` (line 7): Replaced by `blockhash` in Solidity 0.4.22.
   - `sha3` (line 8): Replaced by `keccak256` in Solidity 0.4.22 for clarity, as `keccak256` is the actual hash function used.
   - `msg.gas` (line 10): Replaced by `gasleft()` in Solidity 0.4.21 to avoid confusion with `msg.value`.
   - `throw` (line 12): Replaced by `revert()` in Solidity 0.4.13 for clearer error handling.
   - `callcode` (line 14): Replaced by `delegatecall` in later versions for clarity in maintaining context.
   - `var` keyword (lines 16, 18): Deprecated because of ambiguity in type declaration, explicit types are now recommended.
   - `suicide` (line 20): Renamed to `selfdestruct` in Solidity 0.4.13 for semantic reasons.

# Remediations

- **Update Constructor:**
  Replace the deprecated constructor with the `constructor()` syntax to ensure compatibility with newer versions of Solidity and enhance clarity.
  
- **Replace Deprecated Functions and Keywords:**
  - Replace `constant` with `view` or `pure` depending on state mutability.
  - Use `blockhash` instead of `block.blockhash`.
  - Replace `sha3` with `keccak256`.
  - Use `gasleft()` instead of `msg.gas`.
  - Replace `throw` with `revert()` for error handling.
  - Use `delegatecall` instead of `callcode`.
  - Replace all `var` declarations with explicit type declarations.
  - Use `selfdestruct` instead of `suicide`.

- **General Code Clean-up:**
  - Remove or replace any outdated syntax and ensure that the contract adheres to the latest security practices.
  - Conduct thorough testing and auditing of the contract to ensure that changes do not introduce new vulnerabilities.

Implementing these remediations will help ensure that the contract is secure, up-to-date, and compatible with the latest Ethereum virtual machine specifications.
