# Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract MyContract {
    uint public data;

    function MyContract(uint _data) public { // line 5
        data = _data;
    }
}
```

The vulnerability in the above smart contract lies in the constructor function. In Solidity versions prior to 0.4.22, constructors are defined using a function with the same name as the contract. However, this approach is error-prone because if the contract name is changed and the constructor function name is not updated to match, the function intended as a constructor will not act as one and will be callable by anyone like a regular function. This can lead to unexpected behavior and security issues.

# Remediations

1. **Use the `constructor` keyword**: From Solidity version 0.4.22 onwards, it is recommended to define constructors using the `constructor` keyword. This approach is less error-prone and makes the intention of the code clearer.

   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

   contract MyContract {
       uint public data;

       constructor(uint _data) public {
           data = _data;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Consistent Naming**: If using a version of Solidity prior to 0.4.22, ensure that the constructor function name is always updated to match the contract name whenever the contract name is changed. This practice, while manageable, is less safe than using the `constructor` keyword and should be handled with care to avoid discrepancies.
