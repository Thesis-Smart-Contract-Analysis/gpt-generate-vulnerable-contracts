# Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

The vulnerability in the above smart contract lies in the function `_sendWinnings()`. This function is intended to be a helper function that should only be called internally from within the contract. However, because it lacks an explicit visibility specifier, it defaults to `public` visibility due to Solidity's rules on function visibility. This means that any external user can call `_sendWinnings()` directly, potentially allowing unauthorized withdrawal of funds if they can meet the condition in `withdrawWinnings()`.

# Remediations

1. **Set Explicit Visibility for Functions**: To prevent unauthorized access, `_sendWinnings()` should be explicitly marked as `internal`. This ensures that it cannot be called from outside the contract, only from other functions within the same contract.

   ```solidity
   function _sendWinnings() internal {
       msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
   }
   ```

2. **Upgrade Solidity Version**: Consider upgrading to a newer version of Solidity (at least ^0.5.0) where specifying function visibility is mandatory. This helps avoid unintentional errors related to default visibilities.

3. **Comprehensive Testing and Audits**: Implement thorough testing and potentially engage in external audits to ensure that access control mechanisms are correctly implemented and that there are no unintended public functions or other vulnerabilities.

By applying these remediations, the contract will be more secure against unauthorized access and potential exploitation of its functions.
