# Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract StackDepthAttack {
    uint public count = 0;

    function callDepthAttack(uint depth) public {
        if (depth > 0) {
            this.callDepthAttack(depth - 1); // line 7: Vulnerable to stack size limit
        }
        count += 1; // Increment count after each recursive call
    }
}
```

## Description of the Vulnerability

The vulnerability in the above smart contract arises from the recursive call to `callDepthAttack` within itself. In Solidity, there is a limit to the call stack depth, which is 1024. If the recursion depth exceeds this limit, it will cause a stack overflow error, leading to the failure of the transaction. This can be exploited to create a denial of service (DoS) attack by intentionally calling `callDepthAttack` with a depth close to the stack limit, preventing the contract from completing its execution successfully.

# Remediations

1. **Limiting Recursion Depth**: Implement a check to ensure that the recursion does not exceed a safe limit well below the stack size limit of 1024. This can prevent the stack from getting too deep and hitting the stack overflow error.

    ```solidity
    function callDepthAttack(uint depth) public {
        require(depth <= 500, "Max recursion depth exceeded");
        if (depth > 0) {
            this.callDepthAttack(depth - 1);
        }
        count += 1;
    }
    ```

2. **Avoiding Unbounded Recursion**: Refactor the function to use iterative logic instead of recursion. This approach eliminates the risk associated with stack depth limits by using loop constructs which do not add to the call stack.

    ```solidity
    function callDepthAttack(uint depth) public {
        for (uint i = 0; i < depth; i++) {
            count += 1;
        }
    }
    ```

By implementing these remediations, the smart contract can avoid vulnerabilities related to the stack size limit and ensure more robust handling of function calls, especially in scenarios involving potentially deep recursive operations.
