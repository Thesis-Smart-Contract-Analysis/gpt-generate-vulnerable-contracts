This hardcoded gas amount may not be sufficient for the called contract to perform its operations, especially if those operations involve state changes or other gas-intensive computations. This can lead to a situation where the `executeTransaction` function consistently fails because the called contract cannot complete its execution within the provided gas limit, effectively allowing for a denial of service (DoS) where legitimate transactions cannot be processed. This is known as the Insufficient Gas Griefing vulnerability.\n\n# Remediations\n\n1. **Remove Hardcoded Gas Limit**: Avoid using hardcoded gas limits in calls to external contracts. Instead, allow the transaction to use all available gas or a dynamically calculated amount based on the operations expected to be performed by the called contract.\n\n    ```solidity\n    (bool success, ) = target.call(data);\n    require(success, \"Transaction execution failed.\");\n    ```\n\n2. **Gas Stipend Management**: If there is a need to limit gas due to specific reasons (e.g., preventing reentrancy or other attacks), ensure that the stipend is calculated based on realistic estimates of the called function's gas requirements. This can be achieved by thorough testing or by implementing mechanisms that adjust the gas based on feedback from previous transactions.\n\n3. **Implement Fallback Strategies**: In scenarios where the gas provided might still be insufficient, implement fallback mechanisms or retries with increased gas, especially if the transaction is critical. This can be managed through a multi-step process where the transaction is retried with a higher gas limit if it fails initially.\n\n4. **Use of try/catch for External Calls**: For Solidity versions 0.6.0 and above, use try/catch to handle failures in external calls gracefully. This allows the contract to manage execution errors more effectively and decide on further actions when a call fails.\n\n    ```solidity\n    try target.call(data) {\n        // Handle successful execution\n    } catch {\n        // Handle failed execution\n        revert(\"Transaction execution failed.\");\n    }\n    ```\n\nBy implementing these remediations, the contract can be protected against the Insufficient Gas Griefing vulnerability, ensuring that operations are not arbitrarily limited by gas constraints and that the contract remains functional and secure under various conditions.",
