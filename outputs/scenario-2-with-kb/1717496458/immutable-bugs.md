# Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() {  // line 4
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {  // line 9
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

The vulnerability in the above smart contract lies in the visibility of the `_sendWinnings` function. By default, the visibility of functions in Solidity is `public` if not explicitly specified. This means that the `_sendWinnings` function can be called by anyone, not just internally from within the contract itself. This could lead to unauthorized withdrawals from the contract if an attacker calls this function directly.

# Remediations

1. **Explicitly Declare Function Visibility**: Ensure that the `_sendWinnings` function is declared as `internal` to prevent external calls. This restricts the function to only be callable within the contract itself or by derived contracts, which is the intended behavior.

   ```solidity
   function _sendWinnings() internal {
       msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
   }
   ```

2. **Upgrade Solidity Version**: Consider upgrading to a newer version of Solidity (at least ^0.5.0) where it is mandatory to specify the visibility of functions. This helps avoid unintentional errors related to function visibility.

3. **Use Modifiers for Additional Checks**: Implement custom modifiers to check conditions before executing sensitive functions like transferring Ether. For example, you could create a modifier to check that the `withdrawWinnings` function is only called if certain conditions about the game state or the sender's address are met.

   ```solidity
   modifier onlyWhenGameEnded() {
       require(gameEnded, "Game has not ended yet");
       _;
   }

   function withdrawWinnings() public onlyWhenGameEnded {
       _sendWinnings();
   }
   ```

By applying these remediations, the contract can be protected against unauthorized access and execution of critical functions, ensuring that the contract's Ether is handled securely.
