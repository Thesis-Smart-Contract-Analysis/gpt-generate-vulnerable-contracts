# Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings(); // line 7
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

The vulnerability in the above smart contract lies in the `_sendWinnings` function being callable by anyone because it does not have an explicit visibility specifier and defaults to `public`. This allows any external caller to potentially withdraw all the contract's balance without meeting the intended conditions in `withdrawWinnings`.

# Remediations

1. **Set Explicit Visibility for Functions**: Ensure that all functions in the smart contract have an explicit visibility specifier. For the `_sendWinnings` function, setting it to `internal` would restrict its access to only within the contract itself, preventing external unauthorized access.

   ```solidity
   function _sendWinnings() internal {
       msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
   }
   ```

2. **Use Modifiers for Access Control**: Implement a custom modifier to check conditions before executing sensitive functions. This can be used to encapsulate the condition within `withdrawWinnings` and reuse it wherever necessary.

   ```solidity
   modifier isWinner() {
       require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0, "Not the winner");
       _;
   }

   function withdrawWinnings() public isWinner {
       _sendWinnings();
   }

   function _sendWinnings() internal {
       msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
   }
   ```

These remediations help ensure that the contract's functions are accessed only as intended and protect the contract's funds from unauthorized withdrawals.
