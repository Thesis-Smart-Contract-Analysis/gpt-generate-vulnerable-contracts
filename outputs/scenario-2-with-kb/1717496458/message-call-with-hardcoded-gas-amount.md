# Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.12;

contract GasLimitExample {
    address payable target;

    constructor(address payable _target) public {
        target = _target;
    }

    function triggerCall() public {
        // Hardcoded gas amount
        target.call{gas: 100000}(abi.encodeWithSignature("someFunction()")); // line 9
    }
}
```

The vulnerability in the above smart contract lies in the hardcoded gas amount specified in the `triggerCall` function. Hardcoding the gas limit can lead to unexpected behavior if the gas requirements of the called function change due to updates or state changes in the contract. This can result in failed transactions or unintended behavior if the specified gas is too low to perform necessary operations.

# Remediations

1. **Dynamic Gas Calculation**: Instead of hardcoding the gas amount, calculate the required gas based on the current conditions or state of the contract. This can be achieved by initially testing the gas used by `someFunction()` under different conditions and implementing a formula or method to adjust the gas limit dynamically.

2. **Gas Estimation Tools**: Utilize built-in functions like `estimateGas` to dynamically determine the appropriate amount of gas to send with the transaction. This method involves simulating the transaction to estimate the gas usage before actually sending the transaction.

3. **Remove Hardcoded Gas Limit**: If the environment and contract functions are stable and unlikely to change, removing the hardcoded gas limit and allowing the transaction to use the default gas amount provided by the sender or the network might be sufficient. This approach relies on the network's mechanisms to handle gas allocation efficiently.

By implementing these remediations, the contract can adapt to changes in gas requirements and reduce the risk of transaction failures due to insufficient gas limits.
