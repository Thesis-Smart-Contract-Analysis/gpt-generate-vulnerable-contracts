By default, the visibility of functions in Solidity is `public` if not explicitly stated. This means that the `_sendWinnings()` function can be called by anyone, not just internally from within the contract itself. This could lead to unauthorized withdrawals from the contract if an attacker calls this function directly.\n\n# Remediations\n\n1. **Explicitly Declare Function Visibility:**\n   - The `_sendWinnings()` function should be declared as `internal` to ensure that it can only be called by other functions within the same contract and not externally. This prevents unauthorized access to the function.\n\n   ```solidity\n   function _sendWinnings() internal {\n       msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Upgrade Solidity Version:**\n   - Consider upgrading the Solidity compiler version to `0.5.0` or later. Starting from version `0.5.0`, Solidity requires explicit declaration of function visibility. This helps avoid unintentional errors related to function visibility that could lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\n   ```solidity\n   pragma solidity ^0.5.0;\n\n   contract HashForEther {\n       function withdrawWinnings() public {\n           require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);\n           _sendWinnings();\n       }\n       \n       function _sendWinnings() internal {\n           msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\nBy implementing these remediations, the contract will be protected against unauthorized access to critical functions that manage the transfer of Ether, thereby enhancing the security of the contract.",
