# Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

## Description of the Vulnerability

The vulnerability in the above smart contract lies in the `_sendWinnings` function. This function is intended to be a helper function that should only be called by `withdrawWinnings`. However, because `_sendWinnings` does not explicitly specify its visibility, it defaults to `public` (in Solidity versions before 0.5.0). This means that any external user can directly call `_sendWinnings` and potentially withdraw all the contract's balance without meeting the intended requirement of having the last 8 hex characters of their address as `0`.

# Remediations

1. **Explicitly Declare Function Visibility:**
   - Modify the `_sendWinnings` function to include the `internal` visibility keyword. This restricts its usage such that it can only be called by other functions within the contract and not by external entities.

   ```solidity
   function _sendWinnings() internal {
       msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
   }
   ```

2. **Upgrade Solidity Version:**
   - Consider upgrading the contract to use Solidity version 0.5.0 or later. From version 0.5.0 onwards, specifying the visibility of functions is mandatory, which helps avoid unintentional exposure of functions that should be internal.

   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

   contract HashForEther {
       function withdrawWinnings() public {
           require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
           _sendWinnings();
       }
       
       function _sendWinnings() internal {
           msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
       }
   }
   ```

By implementing these remediations, the contract will be more secure against unauthorized withdrawals, ensuring that only eligible parties can execute the `_sendWinnings` function as originally intended.
