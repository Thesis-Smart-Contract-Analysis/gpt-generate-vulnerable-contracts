        "content": "### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**\n\n**Severity:**\nHigh\n\n**Description:**\nThe `selectWinner` function allows the contract to transfer funds to the player's address using `call.value`. This can potentially lead to a reentrancy vulnerability if the player's address is a malicious contract that calls back into the `OddEven` contract before the state is updated.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `selectWinner` function:\n  ```solidity\n  (bool success, ) = players[n%2].addr.call.value(address(this).balance)(\"\");\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, it is recommended to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Ensure that state changes are made before any external calls. Consider using the withdrawal pattern to separate the transfer of funds from updating the contract state. Use the latest Solidity version to leverage the built-in security features and best practices.",
