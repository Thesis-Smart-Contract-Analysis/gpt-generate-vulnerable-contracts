### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The `selectWinner` function transfers funds to the player's address using a `call` function. This can potentially lead to a reentrancy vulnerability if the recipient address is a contract that calls back into the `OddEven` contract before the state is updated.

**Locations:**

- In the `selectWinner` function:
  ```solidity
  (bool success, ) = players[n%2].addr.call.value(address(this).balance)("");
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, it is recommended to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Ensure that state changes are made before any external calls are made. Consider using the `transfer` or `send` functions instead of `call.value` to transfer funds, as they provide some level of protection against reentrancy attacks. Additionally, limit the amount of Ether transferred in a single call and avoid calling unknown external contracts.
