        "content": "### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**\n\n**Severity:**\nMedium\n\n**Description:**\nThe `selectWinner` function transfers funds to the player's address using a `call` function. This can potentially lead to a reentrancy vulnerability if the recipient address is a contract that calls back into the `OddEven` contract before the state is updated.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `selectWinner` function:\n  ```solidity\n  (bool success, ) = players[n%2].addr.call.value(address(this).balance)(\"\");\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, it is recommended to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Ensure that state changes are made before any external calls are made. Consider using the `transfer` or `send` functions instead of `call.value` to transfer funds, as they provide some level of protection against reentrancy attacks. Additionally, limit the amount of Ether transferred in a single call and avoid calling unknown external contracts.",
