Implement checks before performing arithmetic operations to prevent overflow/underflow scenarios.\n\n### 2. **Uninitialized Storage**\n\n**Severity:**\nLow\n\n**Description:**\nThe `delete players;` statement in the `selectWinner` function does not reset the storage slot to its initial state. This can lead to potential issues if the contract logic relies on the assumption that storage variables are reset to their default values.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `selectWinner` function:\n  ```solidity\n  delete players;\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate uninitialized storage vulnerabilities, explicitly reset the storage variables to their initial values or use a separate function to reset the state variables to avoid unexpected behavior due to uninitialized storage slots.",
