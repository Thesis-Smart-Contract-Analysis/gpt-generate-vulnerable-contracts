### 1. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The addition operation `uint n = players[0].number + players[1].number;` in the `selectWinner` function could potentially result in an integer overflow if the sum of the two numbers exceeds the maximum value that a `uint` can hold.

**Locations:**

- In the `selectWinner` function:
  ```solidity
  uint n = players[0].number + players[1].number;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities, you can use SafeMath library functions for arithmetic operations to ensure that the result does not exceed the maximum value. Implement checks before performing arithmetic operations to prevent overflow/underflow scenarios.

### 2. **Uninitialized Storage**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The `delete players;` statement in the `selectWinner` function does not reset the storage slot to its initial state. This can lead to potential issues if the contract logic relies on the assumption that storage variables are reset to their default values.

**Locations:**

- In the `selectWinner` function:
  ```solidity
  delete players;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate uninitialized storage vulnerabilities, explicitly reset the storage variables to their initial values or use a separate function to reset the state variables to avoid unexpected behavior due to uninitialized storage slots.
