### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The `forward` function in the smart contract uses `delegatecall` without any checks or safeguards, which can potentially lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities if the callee contract performs any state changes after the `delegatecall`.

**Locations:**

- In the `forward` function:
  ```solidity
  require(callee.delegatecall(_data));
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, ensure that the contract state is updated before making the `delegatecall`, use checks-effects-interactions pattern, and consider using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern to separate state changes from external calls.

### 2. **Gas Limit Exhaustion Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The `forward` function does not include any gas limit for the `delegatecall`, which can potentially lead to gas limit exhaustion if the callee contract consumes excessive gas.

**Locations:**

- In the `forward` function:
  ```solidity
  require(callee.delegatecall(_data));
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate gas limit exhaustion vulnerabilities, consider specifying a gas limit for the `delegatecall` to prevent excessive gas consumption and potential out-of-gas errors. Implement proper gas management strategies to handle gas limits effectively.
