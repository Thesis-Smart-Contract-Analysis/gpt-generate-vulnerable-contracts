        "content": "### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**\n\n**Severity:**\nHigh\n\n**Description:**\nThe `forward` function in the smart contract uses `delegatecall` to execute code from the `callee` address. This can potentially lead to a reentrancy vulnerability where the callee contract can call back into the Proxy contract before the initial call is completed, allowing for unexpected behavior and potential security risks.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `forward` function:\n  ```solidity\n  require(callee.delegatecall(_data));\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, it is recommended to follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. Ensure that all state changes are made before any external calls are made. Consider using the `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy attacks by adding a check to disallow reentrant calls within the same function. Additionally, limit the amount of gas forwarded in delegatecall to prevent potential gas-related vulnerabilities. \n\n### 2. **Unrestricted Access Control**\n\n**Severity:**\nHigh\n\n**Description:**\nThe `owner` variable in the Proxy contract is set to the address of the deployer in the constructor, but there are no access control mechanisms implemented to restrict who can call the `forward` function. This lack of access control can lead to unauthorized parties being able to execute arbitrary code through the Proxy contract.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `forward` function:\n  No access control check implemented.\n\n**Mitigation:**\nImplement proper access control mechanisms to restrict who can call the `forward` function. Consider using modifiers like `onlyOwner` or `onlyAuthorized` to ensure that only specific addresses can invoke sensitive functions. You can also utilize role-based access control patterns to manage different levels of permissions within the contract. Regularly review and update access control logic to prevent unauthorized access to critical functions.",
