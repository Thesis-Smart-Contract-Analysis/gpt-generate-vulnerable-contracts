### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The `forward` function in the smart contract uses `delegatecall` without any checks or restrictions, which can potentially lead to reentrancy attacks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to re-enter the contract and manipulate its state.

**Locations:**

- In the `forward` function:
  ```solidity
  require(callee.delegatecall(_data));
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, consider using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern, where you perform all state changes before interacting with external contracts. Additionally, you can implement a reentrancy guard by using a boolean flag to track the state of the contract during external calls and prevent reentrant calls. 

### 2. **Unrestricted Delegatecall**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The `forward` function allows for arbitrary code execution through `delegatecall`, which can be dangerous if not properly controlled. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.

**Locations:**

- In the `forward` function:
  ```solidity
  require(callee.delegatecall(_data));
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate the risk associated with unrestricted `delegatecall`, consider implementing proper access control mechanisms to restrict which contracts can be called using `delegatecall`. Additionally, carefully validate and sanitize input parameters to prevent malicious code execution.
