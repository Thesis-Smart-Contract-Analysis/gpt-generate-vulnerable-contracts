        "content": "### 1. **Vulnerability Type**\n\n**Severity:**\nMedium\n\n**Description:**\nThe contract uses the `keccak256` function with `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` and `now` to generate a random number for the answer. This method is not secure for generating random numbers as miners can manipulate the blockhash to their advantage.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the constructor function:\n  ```solidity\n  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a more secure source of randomness, such as an oracle service or a commit-reveal scheme, to ensure that the random number generation cannot be manipulated by miners.\n\n### 2. **Vulnerability Type**\n\n**Severity:**\nMedium\n\n**Description:**\nThe contract does not have proper access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the `guess` function and potentially drain the contract balance.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `guess` function:\n  ```solidity\n  require(msg.value == 1 ether);\n  if (n == answer) {\n      msg.sender.transfer(2 ether);\n  }\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nImplement access control mechanisms such as only allowing specific addresses to call the `guess` function or using modifiers to restrict access based on certain conditions. Additionally, consider adding proper validation checks to ensure that only valid inputs are accepted in the `guess` function.",
