### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract uses the `keccak256` function with `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` and `now` to generate a random number for the answer. This method is not secure for generating random numbers as miners can manipulate the blockhash to their advantage.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a more secure source of randomness, such as an oracle service or a commit-reveal scheme, to ensure that the random number generation cannot be manipulated by miners.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the `guess` function and potentially drain the contract balance.

**Locations:**

- In the `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == 1 ether);
  if (n == answer) {
      msg.sender.transfer(2 ether);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement access control mechanisms such as only allowing specific addresses to call the `guess` function or using modifiers to restrict access based on certain conditions. Additionally, consider adding proper validation checks to ensure that only valid inputs are accepted in the `guess` function.
