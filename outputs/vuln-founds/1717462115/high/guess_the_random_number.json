This method is predictable and can be manipulated by miners to influence the outcome of the random number generation.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the constructor function:\n  ```solidity\n  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more secure and reliable source of randomness, such as Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) or an oracle service. By integrating a secure randomness solution, the contract can ensure that the generated numbers are not predictable or manipulatable by external actors.",
