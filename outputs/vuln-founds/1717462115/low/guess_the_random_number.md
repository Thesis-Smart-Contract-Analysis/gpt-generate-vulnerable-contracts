### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The constructor function name should match the contract name in newer Solidity versions to prevent confusion and potential issues.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  function GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge() public payable {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Rename the constructor function to match the contract name to adhere to the latest Solidity conventions and avoid potential confusion or issues.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract uses the `blockhash` and `now` functions to generate randomness, which can be manipulated by miners in certain scenarios.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider using more secure and reliable sources of randomness, such as Chainlink VRF oracles, to prevent potential manipulation by miners and ensure fairness in the randomness generation process.
