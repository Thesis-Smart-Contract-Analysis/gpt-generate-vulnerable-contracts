### 1. **Use of `keccak256` for Random Number Generation**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
Using `keccak256` for generating random numbers can be predictable and manipulable by miners or attackers, especially when combined with `blockhash` and `now` which are not suitable for randomness.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Use a more secure and reliable source of randomness, such as Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) or an oracle service, to ensure the randomness of the generated number.

### 2. **Lack of Access Control**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the `guess` function and potentially drain the contract's balance.

**Locations:**

- In the `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  function guess(uint8 n) public payable {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement access control mechanisms such as `onlyOwner` modifier or role-based access control to restrict who can call sensitive functions like `guess` and manage the contract's state.

### 3. **Lack of Event Logging**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract does not emit any events to log important contract interactions, making it harder to track and analyze the contract's behavior.

**Locations:**

- In the `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  if (n == answer) {
      msg.sender.transfer(2 ether);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Add event logging using `emit` statements to provide transparency and visibility into important contract actions, such as successful guesses or fund transfers. This can help in monitoring and auditing contract activities.
