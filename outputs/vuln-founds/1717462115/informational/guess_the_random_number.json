        "content": "### 1. **Use of `keccak256` for Random Number Generation**\n\n**Severity:**\nInformational\n\n**Description:**\nUsing `keccak256` for generating random numbers can be predictable and manipulable by miners or attackers, especially when combined with `blockhash` and `now` which are not suitable for randomness.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the constructor function:\n  ```solidity\n  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nUse a more secure and reliable source of randomness, such as Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) or an oracle service, to ensure the randomness of the generated number.\n\n### 2. **Lack of Access Control**\n\n**Severity:**\nInformational\n\n**Description:**\nThe contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the `guess` function and potentially drain the contract's balance.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `guess` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function guess(uint8 n) public payable {\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nImplement access control mechanisms such as `onlyOwner` modifier or role-based access control to restrict who can call sensitive functions like `guess` and manage the contract's state.\n\n### 3. **Lack of Event Logging**\n\n**Severity:**\nInformational\n\n**Description:**\nThe contract does not emit any events to log important contract interactions, making it harder to track and analyze the contract's behavior.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `guess` function:\n  ```solidity\n  if (n == answer) {\n      msg.sender.transfer(2 ether);\n  }\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nAdd event logging using `emit` statements to provide transparency and visibility into important contract actions, such as successful guesses or fund transfers. This can help in monitoring and auditing contract activities.",
