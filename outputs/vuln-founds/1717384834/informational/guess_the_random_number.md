### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The constructor function name should match the contract name in newer Solidity versions.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  function GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge() public payable {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Update the constructor function to use the `constructor` keyword instead of the contract name to ensure compatibility with newer Solidity versions.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract does not have a visibility modifier for the constructor, which can be misleading.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  function GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge() public payable {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Explicitly specify the visibility modifier for the constructor function (e.g., `constructor`) to improve code readability and maintainability.

### 3. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract uses the `blockhash` and `now` functions to generate randomness, which is not secure for cryptographic purposes.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider using a more secure source of randomness, such as Chainlink VRF or an oracle service, to ensure a higher level of randomness and security in the contract.
