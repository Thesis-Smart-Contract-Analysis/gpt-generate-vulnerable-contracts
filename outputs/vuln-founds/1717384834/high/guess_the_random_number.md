### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract uses `keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now)` to generate a random number for the answer. This method is not secure for generating random numbers as miners can manipulate the blockhash to predict the outcome.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use an external source of randomness, such as an oracle or a Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to ensure a secure and unpredictable random number generation process.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the `guess` function and potentially drain the contract balance.

**Locations:**

- In the `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == 1 ether);
  if (n == answer) {
      msg.sender.transfer(2 ether);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement access control mechanisms such as only allowing specific addresses to call the `guess` function or using modifiers to restrict access based on certain conditions. Additionally, consider implementing withdrawal patterns to prevent unauthorized withdrawals.

### 3. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract does not handle the case where multiple users guess the correct number simultaneously, leading to a race condition where multiple users can claim the reward.

**Locations:**

- In the `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  if (n == answer) {
      msg.sender.transfer(2 ether);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To prevent the race condition, consider using a state variable to track whether the reward has already been claimed and update it accordingly when a user guesses the correct number. Implement a locking mechanism or re-entrancy guard to handle multiple users claiming the reward simultaneously.
