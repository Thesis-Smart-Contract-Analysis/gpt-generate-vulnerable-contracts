This can lead to a reentrancy attack where an attacker can call back into the contract before the state is updated, potentially draining the contract's balance.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `guess` function:\n  ```solidity\n  msg.sender.transfer(2 ether);\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nImplement the checks-effects-interactions pattern to ensure that state changes are made before any external calls. Use the withdrawal pattern to handle fund transfers securely. Consider using the `send` or `transfer` functions with a withdrawal pattern to limit the amount of gas forwarded in case of reentrancy attacks.",
