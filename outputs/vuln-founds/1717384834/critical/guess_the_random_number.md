### 1. **Reentrancy**

**Severity:**
Critical

**Description:**
The `guess` function allows the caller to withdraw funds after the `msg.sender.transfer(2 ether)` call. This can lead to a reentrancy attack where an attacker can call back into the contract before the state is updated, potentially draining the contract's balance.

**Locations:**

- In the `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(2 ether);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern to ensure that state changes are made before any external calls. Use the withdrawal pattern to handle fund transfers securely. Consider using the `send` or `transfer` functions with a withdrawal pattern to limit the amount of gas forwarded in case of reentrancy attacks.
