This method is susceptible to manipulation by miners in a block timestamp attack.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the constructor function:\n  ```solidity\n  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a more secure source of randomness, such as an oracle service or a commit-reveal scheme. Avoid relying on block variables for generating random numbers in a secure context.",
