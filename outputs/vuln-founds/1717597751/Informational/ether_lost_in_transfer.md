### 1. **Reentrancy**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, where an attacker can exploit the transfer of funds to a malicious contract that calls back into the vulnerable contract before the transaction is completed.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawAll` function:
  ```solidity
  payable(0x617F2E2fD72FD9D5503197092aC168c91465E7f2).transfer(
      address(this).balance
  )
  ```

- In the `withdraw` function:
  ```solidity
  payable(receiver).transfer(
      address(this).balance
  )
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy attacks, you should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Ensure that you perform all state changes before interacting with external contracts. Consider using the withdrawal pattern to separate the state changes from the actual transfer of funds. Additionally, you can use the `send` method instead of `transfer` and implement a withdrawal pattern with a withdrawal limit per transaction. 

### 2. **Direct Ether Transfer**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract directly transfers Ether to arbitrary addresses without checking if the transfer was successful, which can lead to Ether being lost in case the transfer fails.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawAll` function:
  ```solidity
  payable(0x617F2E2fD72FD9D5503197092aC168c91465E7f2).transfer(
      address(this).balance
  )
  ```

- In the `withdraw` function:
  ```solidity
  payable(receiver).transfer(
      address(this).balance
  )
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of the `transfer` function to handle failed transfers appropriately. Consider using the `send` method along with checking the return value or implementing a withdrawal pattern where users can withdraw their funds instead of directly transferring Ether to arbitrary addresses.
