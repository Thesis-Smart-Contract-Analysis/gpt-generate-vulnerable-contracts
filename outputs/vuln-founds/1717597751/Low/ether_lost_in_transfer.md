### 1. **Reentrancy**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, where an attacker can exploit the contract by calling the `withdrawAll` or `withdraw` function multiple times before the state changes are updated, potentially draining the contract's balance.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawAll` function:
  ```solidity
  payable(0x617F2E2fD72FD9D5503197092aC168c91465E7f2).transfer(
      address(this).balance
  )
  ```

- In the `withdraw` function:
  ```solidity
  payable(receiver).transfer(
      address(this).balance
  )
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy attacks, you should follow the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern. This involves ensuring that all state changes are made before any external calls are made. Consider using the `send` function instead of `transfer` and implement a withdrawal pattern where the recipient initiates the withdrawal to prevent reentrancy vulnerabilities. Additionally, you can use the withdrawal pattern to limit the amount that can be withdrawn in a single transaction.
