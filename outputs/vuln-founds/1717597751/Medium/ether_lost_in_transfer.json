        "content": "### 1. **Reentrancy**\n\n**Severity:**\nMedium\n\n**Description:**\nThe contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, where an attacker can exploit the contract by calling the `withdraw` functions multiple times before the state changes are updated, allowing them to drain the contract's balance.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `withdrawAll` function:\n  ```solidity\n  payable(0x617F2E2fD72FD9D5503197092aC168c91465E7f2).transfer(\n      address(this).balance\n  )\n  ```\n\n- In the `withdraw` function:\n  ```solidity\n  payable(receiver).transfer(\n      address(this).balance\n  )\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate reentrancy attacks, you should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. This involves ensuring that state changes are made before any external calls. Consider using the `send` function instead of `transfer` and implement a withdrawal pattern where the receiver initiates the withdrawal. Implement a withdrawal pattern where the receiver initiates the withdrawal. Use the withdrawal pattern where the receiver initiates the withdrawal.",
