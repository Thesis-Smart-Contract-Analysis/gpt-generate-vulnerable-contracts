### 1. **Reentrancy**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `withdraw` functions to drain the contract's balance before the state is updated.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawAll` function:
  ```solidity
  payable(0x617F2E2fD72FD9D5503197092aC168c91465E7f2).transfer(
      address(this).balance
  )
  ```

- In the `withdraw` function:
  ```solidity
  payable(receiver).transfer(
      address(this).balance
  )
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy attacks, you should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. This involves performing all state changes before interacting with external contracts. Consider using the withdrawal pattern where users can withdraw their funds instead of pushing funds to them. Implement a withdrawal pattern that allows users to claim their funds instead of pushing funds to them. Use the `send` function instead of `transfer` and ensure that the state is updated before the external call. Consider using reentrancy guards or mutex patterns to prevent multiple calls to critical functions.
