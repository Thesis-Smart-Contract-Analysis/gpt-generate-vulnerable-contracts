### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Critical

**Description:**
The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the `sell` function. The contract transfers tokens to the buyer before updating the balance, which can allow malicious users to re-enter the `sell` function and drain the contract's balance.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that state changes are made before any external calls. In this case, transfer tokens after updating the balance to prevent reentrancy attacks.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the `buy` function. If a user buys a large number of tokens, the multiplication `numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN` can overflow, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement checks to prevent integer overflow, such as using SafeMath library for arithmetic operations. Additionally, consider using a different approach to handle token purchases to avoid potential overflow issues.

### 3. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the `buy` and `sell` functions. This lack of access control can lead to unauthorized token transfers and manipulation of balances.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` and `sell` functions:
  ```solidity
  function buy(uint256 numTokens) public payable {
  function sell(uint256 numTokens) public {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement access control mechanisms, such as using modifiers like `onlyOwner` or `onlyAdmin` to restrict who can call certain functions. Consider implementing role-based access control to manage user permissions effectively.
