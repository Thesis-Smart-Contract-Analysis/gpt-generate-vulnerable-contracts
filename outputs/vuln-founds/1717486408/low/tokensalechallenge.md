### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract does not check for potential integer overflow when calculating the total value of tokens to be purchased in the `buy` function.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the multiplication operation does not result in an integer overflow. Consider using SafeMath library functions for arithmetic operations to prevent overflow vulnerabilities.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract does not handle the case where the user may attempt to sell more tokens than they currently own, potentially resulting in an underflow.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= numTokens);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To address this vulnerability, you should include a check to verify that the user has a sufficient balance of tokens before deducting the sold tokens. Additionally, consider using SafeMath library functions to prevent underflow vulnerabilities in arithmetic operations.
