### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the `sell` function. This vulnerability allows an attacker to repeatedly call the `sell` function before the balance update is completed, potentially draining the contract's balance.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate the reentrancy vulnerability, ensure that state changes are made before any external calls. Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern where you first validate conditions, then update state variables, and finally interact with external contracts or users. Consider using the withdrawal pattern to separate the transfer of funds from state changes. 

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract is susceptible to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack in the `buy` function. An attacker can potentially drain the contract's balance by sending a large value of `numTokens` that causes an integer overflow in the calculation of `msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN`.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To prevent integer overflow, consider using SafeMath library functions for arithmetic operations. Additionally, implement input validation to ensure that the value of `numTokens` is within a reasonable range to prevent DoS attacks.
