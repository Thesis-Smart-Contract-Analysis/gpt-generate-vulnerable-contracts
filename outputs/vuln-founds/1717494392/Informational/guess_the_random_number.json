This can lead to a predictable outcome in the random number generation process.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the constructor function:\n  ```solidity\n  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo improve randomness, consider using a more secure source of randomness such as Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) or an oracle service. It's important to avoid using block-related data for generating random numbers in smart contracts.",
