This can lead to a predictable outcome, allowing attackers to game the system.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the constructor function:\n  ```solidity\n  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo improve randomness, consider using a more secure source of randomness such as an oracle service or a verifiable random function (VRF). Avoid relying on `blockhash` for generating random numbers in smart contracts to prevent potential exploits.",
