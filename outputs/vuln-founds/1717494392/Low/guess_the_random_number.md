### 1. **Incorrect Constructor Name**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The constructor function in Solidity should have the same name as the contract. In this contract, the constructor function is named `GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge`, which is not the correct constructor name in Solidity versions after 0.4.22.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  function GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge() public payable {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Change the constructor function name to `constructor` to adhere to the latest Solidity conventions. This will ensure compatibility with future compiler versions and reduce confusion for developers.

### 2. **Use of `block.blockhash` for Randomness**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract uses `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` combined with `now` to generate a random number for the answer. This method is not secure for generating randomness in smart contracts as miners can manipulate the blockhash within a certain range.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider using a more secure and reliable source of randomness, such as Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) or an oracle service. Using external randomness sources can prevent manipulation and ensure fairness in the contract execution.
