This can lead to the possibility of front-running attacks or unfair advantage in guessing the random number.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the constructor function:\n  ```solidity\n  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo improve randomness and security, consider using an external random number oracle or Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to generate random numbers securely on-chain. This will prevent miners or attackers from predicting or manipulating the random number generation process.",
