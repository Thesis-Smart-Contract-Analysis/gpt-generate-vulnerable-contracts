### 1. **Unprotected Function Visibility**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The functions `withdrawWinnings` and `_sendWinnings` are declared with the default visibility level, which is public. This means that anyone can call these functions, potentially leading to unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract state.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function withdrawWinnings() {
      // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0.
      require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
      _sendWinnings();
  }
  ```

- In the `_sendWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function _sendWinnings() {
      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, explicitly specify the visibility level of the functions to restrict access to only authorized entities. For sensitive functions that should not be accessed externally, use the `internal` or `private` visibility keywords. For functions that need to be accessed externally, consider using `external` or `public` with appropriate access control mechanisms such as modifiers.
