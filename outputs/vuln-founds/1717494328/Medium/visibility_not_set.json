        "content": "### 1. **Unprotected Function Visibility**\n\n**Severity:**\nMedium\n\n**Description:**\nThe functions `withdrawWinnings` and `_sendWinnings` are declared with the default visibility level, which is public. This means that anyone can call these functions, potentially leading to unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract state.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function withdrawWinnings() {\n      // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0.\n      require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);\n      _sendWinnings();\n  }\n  ```\n\n- In the `_sendWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function _sendWinnings() {\n      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);\n  }\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, explicitly specify the visibility level of the functions to restrict access to only authorized entities. For sensitive functions that should not be accessed externally, use the `internal` or `private` visibility keywords. For functions that need to be accessed externally, consider using `external` or `public` with appropriate access control mechanisms such as modifiers.",
