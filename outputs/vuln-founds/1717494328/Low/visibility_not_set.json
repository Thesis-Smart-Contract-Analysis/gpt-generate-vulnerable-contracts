If no visibility specifier is provided, the default is \"public,\" which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function withdrawWinnings() {\n  ```\n\n- In the `_sendWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function _sendWinnings() {\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nExplicitly specify the visibility of functions to ensure clarity and prevent unintended access. For internal functions that are only meant to be called within the contract, use the `internal` visibility specifier. For functions that are meant to be called externally, consider using `public` or `external` based on the intended access level.",
