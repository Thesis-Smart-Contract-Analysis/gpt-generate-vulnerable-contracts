### 1. **SWE-100: Lack of Explicit Visibility Specifiers**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
Functions in Solidity should have explicit visibility specifiers (e.g., public, private, internal, external) to clearly define who can access them. If no visibility specifier is provided, the default is "public," which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function withdrawWinnings() {
  ```

- In the `_sendWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function _sendWinnings() {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Explicitly specify the visibility of functions to ensure clarity and prevent unintended access. For internal functions that are only meant to be called within the contract, use the `internal` visibility specifier. For functions that are meant to be called externally, consider using `public` or `external` based on the intended access level.
