This can lead to potential vulnerabilities as any external account can call this function and withdraw winnings.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function withdrawWinnings() {\n      require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);\n      _sendWinnings();\n  }\n  ```\n\n- In the `_sendWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function _sendWinnings() {\n      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);\n  }\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nExplicitly specify the visibility of functions to restrict access. For sensitive functions like `withdrawWinnings`, consider making them `internal` or `private` to prevent external accounts from directly calling them. Additionally, implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can withdraw winnings.",
