### 1. **SWE-100: Unrestricted Write Operations**

**Severity:**
Critical

**Description:**
The `withdrawWinnings` function does not specify visibility (e.g., `public`, `external, `internal`, or `private`), making it public by default. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities as any external account can call this function and withdraw winnings.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function withdrawWinnings() {
      require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
      _sendWinnings();
  }
  ```

- In the `_sendWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function _sendWinnings() {
      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Explicitly specify the visibility of functions to restrict access. For sensitive functions like `withdrawWinnings`, consider making them `internal` or `private` to prevent external accounts from directly calling them. Additionally, implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can withdraw winnings.
