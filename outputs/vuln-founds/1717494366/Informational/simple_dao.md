### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks where an attacker can repeatedly call the `withdraw` function before the state changes are finalized, allowing them to drain the contract's balance.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdraw` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.sender.call.value(amount)());
  require(msg.sender.call{gas: 2000, value: amount}());
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, it is recommended to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Ensure that state changes are made before any external calls are made. Consider using the withdrawal pattern to separate state changes from external calls. Additionally, you can use the `transfer` function instead of `call.value` to send Ether to addresses, as it includes a gas stipend to prevent reentrancy. 

### 2. **Unchecked External Calls**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract uses external calls without properly checking the return value, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the external call fails.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdraw` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.sender.call.value(amount)());
  require(msg.sender.call{gas: 2000, value: amount}());
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of external calls and handle failure cases appropriately. Consider using the `transfer` function instead of `call.value` as it will revert the transaction if the call fails. Implement error handling mechanisms to handle failures gracefully and prevent unexpected behavior.
