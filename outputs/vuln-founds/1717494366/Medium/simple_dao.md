### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks where an external malicious contract can call back into the `withdraw` function before the state changes are completed, potentially leading to unauthorized fund withdrawals.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdraw` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.sender.call.value(amount)());
  require(msg.sender.call{gas: 2000, value: amount}());
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, it is recommended to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. This involves performing all state changes before interacting with external contracts. Consider using the withdrawal pattern where users can withdraw funds instead of pushing funds to them. Additionally, use the latest Solidity version and best practices to minimize reentrancy risks.
