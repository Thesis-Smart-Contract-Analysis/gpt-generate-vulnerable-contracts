### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks where an attacker can repeatedly call the `withdraw` function to drain the contract's balance before the credit balance is updated.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdraw` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.sender.call.value(amount)());
  require(msg.sender.call{gas: 2000, value: amount}());
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, it is recommended to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. This involves updating the state variables before interacting with external contracts. In this case, you should move the deduction of credit balance to the beginning of the function before any external calls are made.

### 2. **Gas Limit Dependency Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract uses `msg.sender.call{gas: 2000, value: amount}()` which specifies a gas limit of 2000. This can lead to potential issues if the gas stipend is not enough for the external call to complete successfully.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdraw` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.sender.call{gas: 2000, value: amount}());
  ```

**Mitigation:**
It is recommended to avoid specifying gas limits in external calls as it can lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, use the default gas stipend provided by Solidity. If more gas is required for the external call, consider refactoring the contract logic to reduce gas consumption or allow users to withdraw funds in multiple transactions.
