This can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities in the smart contract.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `selectWinner` function:\n  ```solidity\n  uint n = players[0].number + players[1].number;\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities, you can use SafeMath library functions for arithmetic operations. SafeMath provides functions like `add`, `sub`, `mul`, and `div` that prevent overflow and underflow by reverting the transaction if an overflow or underflow is detected.\n\n### 2. **Reentrancy**\n\n**Severity:**\nMedium\n\n**Description:**\nReentrancy vulnerability occurs when a contract calls an external contract before finishing its execution. This can allow the external contract to re-enter the calling contract and potentially manipulate its state.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `selectWinner` function:\n  ```solidity\n  (bool success, ) = players[n%2].addr.call.value(address(this).balance)(\"\");\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, you should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Ensure that all state changes are made before interacting with external contracts. Use the `transfer` or `send` functions instead of `call` to transfer Ether, as they provide some protection against reentrancy attacks. Additionally, consider using the withdrawal pattern to separate state changes from Ether transfers.",
