### 1. **Unprotected Ether Withdrawal**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The `selectWinner` function allows one of the players to withdraw the entire contract balance without explicitly checking if the contract balance is greater than zero before initiating the transfer. This can lead to a scenario where the contract balance is drained unintentionally.

**Locations:**

- In the `selectWinner` function:
  ```solidity
  (bool success, ) = players[n%2].addr.call.value(address(this).balance)("");
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Before initiating the transfer, add a check to ensure that the contract balance is greater than zero to prevent unintentional draining of the contract balance. Additionally, consider implementing a withdrawal pattern where players can withdraw their funds individually rather than in a single transfer operation.

### 2. **Potential Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract uses the `call` function to transfer Ether to the winning player without limiting the gas or implementing a reentrancy guard. This can potentially expose the contract to reentrancy attacks if the receiving address is a malicious contract that triggers a fallback function to re-enter the contract before the transfer is completed.

**Locations:**

- In the `selectWinner` function:
  ```solidity
  (bool success, ) = players[n%2].addr.call.value(address(this).balance)("");
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider using the `transfer` or `send` functions for Ether transfers, as they provide limited gas and are safer than `call`. Implement a reentrancy guard by following the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to ensure that the contract state is updated before any external calls are made.
