### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `selectWinner` function allows for a potential reentrancy vulnerability as it performs an external call to transfer funds before updating the state variables. An attacker could potentially exploit this by having a fallback function in their contract that calls back into the `selectWinner` function before the state is updated, allowing for reentrancy attacks.

**Locations:**

- In the `selectWinner` function:
  ```solidity
  (bool success, ) = players[n%2].addr.call.value(address(this).balance)("");
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Ensure that state changes are made before any external calls. Consider using the `transfer` or `send` functions instead of `call.value` to transfer funds, as they limit the gas forwarded to the receiving contract and prevent reentrancy attacks. Additionally, consider using the withdrawal pattern to separate the transfer of funds from updating the state variables.
