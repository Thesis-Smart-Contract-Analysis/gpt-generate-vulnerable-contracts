### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The `callnotchecked` function in the smart contract allows for reentrancy attacks as it does not check the return value of the `callee.call()` function. This can potentially lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, always check the return value of external contract calls and ensure that sensitive state changes are made before the external call. Implement the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.

### 2. **Unrestricted Ether Withdrawal**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The smart contract does not have any functions for withdrawing Ether, which could potentially lock funds in the contract indefinitely. This lack of withdrawal mechanism can lead to loss of funds for users.

**Locations:**
N/A

**Mitigation:**
Implement a withdrawal function in the smart contract that allows users to withdraw their Ether. Use proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can withdraw funds from the contract. Consider using the "pull" over "push" pattern for withdrawals to prevent reentrancy attacks.

### 3. **Gas Limit Dos Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The `callee.call()` function in the `callnotchecked` function does not specify a gas limit, which can potentially lead to a gas limit DoS attack. An attacker could deploy a contract that consumes all available gas when the `callee` contract is called, causing the transaction to fail.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always specify a gas limit when making external contract calls to prevent gas limit DoS attacks. Estimate the gas required for the call and set an appropriate limit to avoid running out of gas. Implement circuit breakers or gas limits in critical functions to protect against such attacks.
