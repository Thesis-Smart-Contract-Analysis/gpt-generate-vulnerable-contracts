### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The `callnotchecked` function in the smart contract allows for an external contract to call back into the `ReturnValue` contract before the current function completes, potentially leading to reentrancy vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, ensure that external calls are made at the end of the function and implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern to separate state changes from external calls.

### 2. **Unchecked Return Value**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The `callnotchecked` function does not check the return value of the `callee.call()` function, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the external call fails.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of external calls and handle any potential errors appropriately to prevent unexpected behavior in the smart contract.
