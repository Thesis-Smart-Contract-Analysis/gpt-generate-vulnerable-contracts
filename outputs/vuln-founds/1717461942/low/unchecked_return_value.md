### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
Using `address.call()` without checking the return value can lead to potential vulnerabilities as it does not revert the transaction on failure.

**Locations:**

- In the function `callnotchecked`:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of `address.call()` and handle the failure case appropriately by reverting the transaction or taking necessary actions based on the contract logic.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

Using `require(callee.call())` without checking the return value can lead to potential vulnerabilities as it does not revert the transaction on failure.

**Locations:**

- In the function `callchecked`:
  ```solidity

  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of `address.call()` and handle the failure case appropriately by reverting the transaction or taking necessary actions based on the contract logic.
