### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The `call` function in Solidity can be used to call external contracts, and if not handled properly, it can lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities where an external contract can call back into the current contract before the first call is completed.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, ensure that external calls are made at the end of the function and that state changes are handled before the external call. Implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern to separate state changes from external calls. Use the `transfer` or `send` functions instead of `call` whenever possible as they handle the transfer of Ether and prevent reentrancy by limiting gas usage. Consider using reentrancy guards or mutex patterns to prevent multiple calls to critical functions.

### 2. **Unchecked Return Value**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The `call` function in Solidity returns a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the external call. In the `callnotchecked` function, the return value of the `call` function is not checked, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the external call fails.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of external calls to handle potential failures gracefully. Use the `call` function in combination with the `require` statement to revert the transaction if the external call fails. Consider using higher-level abstractions like interfaces or libraries that handle error checking internally to reduce the risk of unchecked return values.
