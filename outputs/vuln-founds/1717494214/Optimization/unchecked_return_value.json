Consider using the `transfer` or `send` functions instead of `call` for sending Ether to prevent reentrancy attacks.",

Below is an example format:\n\n### 1. **show vulnerability type here**\n\n**Severity:**\nshow vulnerability severity here\n\n**Description:**\nshow description here\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the parent function:\n  ```solidity\n  code matched // Line of this code in the smart contract\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nshow mitigation here (You don't need to provide detailed examples for fixes; simply explain how to address the issues clearly)\n\nPlease analyze thoroughly and provide the most comprehensive and accurate results with exactly severity. Remember to show line of code for me in Location section please !!!\n\nBelow is the source code of the smart contract:\npragma solidity 0.4.25;\n\ncontract ReturnValue {\n    function callchecked(address callee) public {\n        //ok: swe-104\n        require(callee.call());\n    }\n\n    function callnotchecked(address callee) public {\n        //ruleid: swe-104\n        callee.call();\n    }\n}\n\n",
