### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `callnotchecked` function in the smart contract allows for an unchecked external call to `callee`, which can potentially lead to a reentrancy vulnerability if the callee contract performs an external call back to the `ReturnValue` contract before completing its execution.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, ensure that external calls are made as the last operation in a function and implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Use the withdrawal pattern to handle ether transfers and consider using the `transfer` or `send` functions instead of `call` for ether transfers. Additionally, consider using reentrancy guards such as the `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy attacks.
