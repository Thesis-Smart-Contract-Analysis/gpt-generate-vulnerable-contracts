### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The `callnotchecked` function in the smart contract does not check the return value of the `callee.call()` function, which can potentially lead to a reentrancy vulnerability. If the callee contract executes a fallback function that calls back to the `ReturnValue` contract, it can re-enter the `callnotchecked` function before it completes its execution.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, always check the return value of external calls and perform any state changes before making the external call. Implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern to ensure that state changes are made before interacting with external contracts.
