This condition is easily exploitable as an attacker can generate addresses that meet this requirement and drain the contract's balance.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can withdraw funds from the contract. Consider using modifiers or access control lists to restrict the withdrawal functionality to specific addresses or roles. Additionally, consider using the `onlyOwner` modifier or similar patterns to restrict access to critical functions.",
