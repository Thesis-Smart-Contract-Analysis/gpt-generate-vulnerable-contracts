This can lead to unauthorized users being able to withdraw winnings or send funds.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function withdrawWinnings() {\n      require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);\n      _sendWinnings();\n  }\n  ```\n\n- In the `_sendWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function _sendWinnings() {\n      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);\n  }\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nImplement access control mechanisms such as `onlyOwner` modifier or use a role-based access control system to restrict who can call these functions. Ensure that only authorized users can withdraw winnings or send funds.",
