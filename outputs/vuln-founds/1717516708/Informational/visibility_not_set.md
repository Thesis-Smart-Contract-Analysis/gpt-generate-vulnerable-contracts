### 1. **Unrestricted Access to Function**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `withdrawWinnings` and `_sendWinnings` functions do not have any access control modifiers, making them publicly accessible to anyone. This can lead to unauthorized users being able to withdraw winnings or send funds.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function withdrawWinnings() {
      require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
      _sendWinnings();
  }
  ```

- In the `_sendWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function _sendWinnings() {
      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement access control mechanisms such as `onlyOwner` modifier or use a role-based access control system to restrict who can call these functions. Ensure that only authorized users can withdraw winnings or send funds.
