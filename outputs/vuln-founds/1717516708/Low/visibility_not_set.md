### 1. **SWE-100: Lack of Explicit Visibility**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The functions `withdrawWinnings` and `_sendWinnings` do not have an explicit visibility modifier, making them default to `public`. This can lead to potential security risks as unintended functions may be able to interact with these functions.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function withdrawWinnings() {
  ```

- In the `_sendWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function _sendWinnings() {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Explicitly specify the visibility of functions by using `public`, `external`, `internal`, or `private` modifiers to clearly define who can access these functions. This helps in reducing the attack surface and prevents unintended access to critical functions.
