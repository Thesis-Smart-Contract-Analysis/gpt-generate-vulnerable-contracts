This can lead to potential security risks as unintended functions may be able to interact with these functions.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function withdrawWinnings() {\n  ```\n\n- In the `_sendWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function _sendWinnings() {\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nExplicitly specify the visibility of functions by using `public`, `external`, `internal`, or `private` modifiers to clearly define who can access these functions. This helps in reducing the attack surface and prevents unintended access to critical functions.",
