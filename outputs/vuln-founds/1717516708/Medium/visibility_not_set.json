This can lead to unauthorized withdrawals and potential loss of funds.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nImplement access control mechanisms such as only allowing specific addresses to withdraw funds or requiring additional authentication before allowing withdrawals. Consider using the `onlyOwner` modifier or implementing a role-based access control system to restrict who can call the withdrawal function.",
