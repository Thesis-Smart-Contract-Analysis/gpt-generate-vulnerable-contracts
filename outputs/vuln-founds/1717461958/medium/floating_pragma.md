### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The pragma solidity version is not specified with a fixed version, leaving the contract vulnerable to potential issues with future compiler versions.

**Locations:**

- In the smart contract:
  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Specify a fixed pragma solidity version to ensure the contract is compiled with a specific compiler version and reduce the risk of compatibility issues with future compiler versions. For example, use `pragma solidity 0.4.25;` instead of `pragma solidity ^0.4.0;`.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract does not have any functions or logic, which may lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if additional functionality is added without proper consideration.

**Locations:**

- In the contract structure:
  ```solidity
  contract PragmaNotLocked {
    uint public x = 1;
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Ensure that the contract includes appropriate functions and logic to handle its intended functionality. Implement proper access control, input validation, and error handling mechanisms to prevent potential vulnerabilities in the future development of the contract.
