### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The pragma solidity version is not specified with a fixed version, potentially leading to unexpected behavior due to compiler upgrades.

**Locations:**

- In the smart contract:
  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Specify a fixed version of the Solidity compiler in the pragma statement to ensure the contract behaves as expected and is not affected by future compiler upgrades. For example, use `pragma solidity 0.4.25;` instead of `pragma solidity ^0.4.0;`.
