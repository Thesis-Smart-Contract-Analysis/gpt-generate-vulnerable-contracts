Relying on `tx.origin` for authentication or authorization checks can lead to potential exploits.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the function `sendTo`:\n  ```solidity\n  require(tx.origin == owner);\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nAvoid using `tx.origin` for authentication or authorization checks. Instead, use `msg.sender` to verify the immediate caller of the function. Consider implementing access control mechanisms such as modifiers to restrict access to certain functions based on the caller's address.",
