Relying on `tx.origin` for authentication or authorization checks can lead to potential security risks.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the function `sendTo`:\n  ```solidity\n  require(tx.origin == owner);\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nAvoid using `tx.origin` for authentication or authorization checks. Instead, use `msg.sender` for verifying the immediate caller of the function. This helps in preventing potential attacks that exploit the `tx.origin` property.",
