### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The constructor function is defined using the old style constructor syntax, which can lead to confusion and potential issues.

**Locations:**

- In the `Example` function:
  ```solidity
  function Example() public {
    admin = address(0x0);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Use the constructor keyword instead of defining a function with the same name as the contract for better clarity and to adhere to the latest Solidity conventions.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The initial value of the `admin` variable is set to the zero address in the `Example` function, which might not be the intended behavior.

**Locations:**

- In the `Example` function:
  ```solidity
  admin = address(0x0);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Explicitly set the intended admin address in the constructor or initialize it to `msg.sender` in the declaration to ensure a valid address is assigned initially.
