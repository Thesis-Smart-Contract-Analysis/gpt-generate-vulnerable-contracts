### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks as it does not follow the best practice of updating state variables before making external calls.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  admin = msg.sender;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Ensure that state variables are updated before making any external calls to prevent reentrancy attacks.

### 2. **Unused Constructor Function**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract has an unused constructor function `Example() public` which can lead to confusion and potential issues during contract deployment.

**Locations:**

- In the unused constructor function:
  ```solidity
  admin = address(0x0);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Remove the unused constructor function to avoid confusion and potential issues during deployment.
