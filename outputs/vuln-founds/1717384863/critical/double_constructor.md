### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Critical

**Description:**
The constructor function is not defined correctly. In Solidity, the constructor should be defined using the `constructor` keyword, but in this contract, the constructor is defined using the function name `Example`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the function `Example`:
  ```solidity
  function Example() public {
    admin = address(0x0);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Define the constructor using the `constructor` keyword instead of using a function with the contract name. This will ensure that the constructor is executed only once during contract deployment and prevent any unintended consequences.

```solidity
constructor() public {
  admin = msg.sender;
}
```

By making this change, you ensure that the constructor is correctly defined and executed as expected during contract deployment.
