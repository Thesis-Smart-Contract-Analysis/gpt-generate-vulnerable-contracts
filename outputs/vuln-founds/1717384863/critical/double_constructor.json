In Solidity, the constructor should be defined using the `constructor` keyword, but in this contract, the constructor is defined using the function name `Example`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the function `Example`:\n  ```solidity\n  function Example() public {\n    admin = address(0x0);\n  }\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nDefine the constructor using the `constructor` keyword instead of using a function with the contract name. This will ensure that the constructor is executed only once during contract deployment and prevent any unintended consequences.\n\n```solidity\nconstructor() public {\n  admin = msg.sender;\n}\n```\n\nBy making this change, you ensure that the constructor is correctly defined and executed as expected during contract deployment.",
