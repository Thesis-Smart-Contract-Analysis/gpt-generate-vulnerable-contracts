Ensure that the admin address is properly initialized to prevent unintended access.\n\n### 3. **Vulnerability Type**\n\n**Severity:**\nMedium\n\n**Description:**\nThe admin variable is declared as public, which exposes it to potential manipulation by external actors.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- Variable declaration:\n  ```solidity\n  address public admin;\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nConsider changing the visibility of the admin variable to private and implement appropriate access control mechanisms to restrict access to critical contract functionalities. This will help prevent unauthorized modifications to the admin address.",
