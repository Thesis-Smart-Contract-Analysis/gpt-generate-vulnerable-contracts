### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The constructor function is not defined correctly. In Solidity, the constructor should be defined using the `constructor` keyword instead of using a function with the same name as the contract.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  function Example() public {
    admin = address(0x0);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, use the `constructor` keyword to define the constructor function. This ensures that the function is only executed once during contract deployment and initialization.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `admin` variable is set to the zero address in the constructor function. This can lead to potential security risks as the zero address is a valid Ethereum address and can be controlled by an attacker.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  function Example() public {
    admin = address(0x0);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, set the `admin` variable to a specific address that is controlled by the contract owner or implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can modify critical contract state variables.
