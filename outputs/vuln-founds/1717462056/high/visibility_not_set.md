### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The visibility of the functions `withdrawWinnings` and `_sendWinnings` is not explicitly specified, making them public by default. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities as unintended users can access and call these functions.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function withdrawWinnings() {
      // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0.
      require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
      _sendWinnings();
  }
  ```

- In the `_sendWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function _sendWinnings() {
      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Explicitly specify the visibility of functions to restrict access. Use `internal` or `private` visibility for functions that should not be accessed externally. Additionally, consider implementing access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can interact with critical functions.
