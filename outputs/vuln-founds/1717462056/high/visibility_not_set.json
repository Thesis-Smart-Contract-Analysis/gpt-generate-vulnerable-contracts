This can lead to potential vulnerabilities as unintended users can access and call these functions.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function withdrawWinnings() {\n      // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0.\n      require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);\n      _sendWinnings();\n  }\n  ```\n\n- In the `_sendWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function _sendWinnings() {\n      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);\n  }\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nExplicitly specify the visibility of functions to restrict access. Use `internal` or `private` visibility for functions that should not be accessed externally. Additionally, consider implementing access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can interact with critical functions.",
