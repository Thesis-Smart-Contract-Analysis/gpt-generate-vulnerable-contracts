### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract uses the `keccak256` function with `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)` and `now` to generate a random number for the answer. This method is not secure for generating random numbers as miners can manipulate the blockhash to predict the outcome.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using an external source of randomness, such as an oracle service, to provide a secure and unpredictable random number generation mechanism.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms in place. The `guess` function can be called by anyone, allowing potential attackers to guess the number without any restrictions.

**Locations:**

- In the `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  function guess(uint8 n) public payable {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement access control mechanisms such as `onlyOwner` or `onlyAuthorized` modifiers to restrict who can call the `guess` function. This will prevent unauthorized users from interacting with the contract and potentially exploiting it.
