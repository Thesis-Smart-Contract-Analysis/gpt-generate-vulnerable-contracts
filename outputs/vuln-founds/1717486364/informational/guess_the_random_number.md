### 1. **Use of `blockhash` for Random Number Generation**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
Using `blockhash` for generating random numbers can be predictable and manipulated by miners.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider using a more secure and unpredictable source of randomness, such as Chainlink VRF or an oracle service, to ensure fairness and security in random number generation.

### 2. **Lack of Access Control**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the `guess` function and potentially drain the contract's balance.

**Locations:**

- In the `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  function guess(uint8 n) public payable {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement access control mechanisms such as role-based access control or require specific conditions to be met before allowing execution of critical functions to prevent unauthorized access and protect the contract's funds.
