This can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo properly check if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0, you should use bitwise operations or other appropriate methods to extract the desired portion of the address. It's crucial to ensure that address manipulation is done correctly to avoid vulnerabilities related to address validation.",
