### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The functions `withdrawWinnings` and `_sendWinnings` do not specify visibility (public, private, external, internal). By default, functions are public, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function withdrawWinnings() {
  ```

- In the `_sendWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function _sendWinnings() {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Explicitly specify the visibility of functions to ensure clarity and prevent unintended access. Consider making functions private if they are only intended to be called internally within the contract. 

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The `withdrawWinnings` function uses a simplistic condition to determine the winner based on the last 8 hex characters of the sender's address. This method of determining winners may not be secure and could potentially lead to manipulation or unintended outcomes.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement a more secure and robust method for determining winners, such as using cryptographic randomness or verifiable sources of randomness. Additionally, consider using established standards or best practices for fair and secure prize distribution mechanisms.
