### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The functions `withdrawWinnings` and `_sendWinnings` have no visibility specifier, making them public by default. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities as unintended users can access and interact with these functions.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function withdrawWinnings() {
      require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
      _sendWinnings();
  }
  ```

- In the `_sendWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function _sendWinnings() {
      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Explicitly specify the visibility of functions to restrict access. Use `internal` or `private` visibility for functions that should not be accessed externally. Additionally, consider implementing access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can call sensitive functions. 

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The `withdrawWinnings` function relies on checking the last 8 hex characters of the sender's address to determine if they are a winner. This method of determining winners based on address manipulation is not secure and can be exploited by attackers.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Avoid using address manipulation for security-sensitive operations. Consider implementing a more secure and random method for determining winners, such as using cryptographic randomness or an oracle. Additionally, ensure that the logic for determining winners is robust and cannot be easily manipulated by external actors.
