This can lead to potential security risks as unintended users may be able to call these functions.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the function `withdrawWinnings`:\n  ```solidity\n  function withdrawWinnings() {\n      // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0.\n      require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);\n      _sendWinnings();\n  }\n  ```\n\n- In the function `_sendWinnings`:\n  ```solidity\n  function _sendWinnings() {\n      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);\n  }\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nExplicitly specify the visibility of functions to ensure that only intended users or contracts can access them. For example, you can use the `internal` or `private` visibility keywords based on your requirements. Additionally, consider implementing access control mechanisms to restrict function calls to authorized users or contracts.",
