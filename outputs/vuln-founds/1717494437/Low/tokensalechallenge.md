### 1. **Integer Underflow**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
Integer underflow can occur when subtracting a value from an unsigned integer that results in a negative number, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  balanceOf[msg.sender] -= numTokens;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Ensure that the subtraction operation does not result in a negative value by adding a require statement to check if the sender has enough tokens before subtracting.

### 2. **Unchecked Transfer**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
Using `transfer` without checking the return value can lead to vulnerabilities if the transfer fails, as the contract will not handle the failure and may leave the contract in an inconsistent state.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Use a pattern where the recipient withdraws funds instead of pushing funds to them, or implement a more robust error handling mechanism to handle failed transfers. Consider using the `send` method along with checking the return value to handle failures appropriately.
