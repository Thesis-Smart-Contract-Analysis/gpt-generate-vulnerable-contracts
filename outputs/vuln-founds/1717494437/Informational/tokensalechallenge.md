### 1. **Integer Underflow**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
Integer underflow can occur when subtracting a value from an unsigned integer that results in a negative number, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  balanceOf[msg.sender] -= numTokens;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Ensure that the subtraction operation does not result in a negative value by adding appropriate checks or using safe math libraries to handle arithmetic operations securely.

### 2. **Unchecked Transfer**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
Unchecked transfer of Ether can lead to vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks or unexpected behavior in the contract.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Use the pull payment pattern or implement checks-effects-interactions pattern to ensure that Ether transfers are handled securely and do not introduce vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks. Consider using the `transfer` function with proper checks or using more advanced patterns like the withdrawal pattern.
