### 1. **Integer Underflow/Overflow**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
Integer underflow and overflow vulnerabilities can occur when arithmetic operations result in a value that is outside the expected range of values for the data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate integer underflow and overflow vulnerabilities, ensure that arithmetic operations are carefully validated to prevent values from exceeding the expected range. Implement checks and validations to handle potential edge cases and ensure that the contract behaves as intended even in extreme scenarios.

### 2. **Reentrancy**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
Reentrancy vulnerabilities occur when a contract's state is modified before the current function call completes, allowing an attacker to re-enter the function and potentially manipulate the contract's state in unintended ways.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, follow the best practices for secure smart contract development. Implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern, where state changes are made before interacting with external contracts. Use the withdrawal pattern to handle fund transfers securely and ensure that the contract's state is updated before transferring funds to external entities.

### 3. **Unprotected Ether Withdrawal**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
Unprotected ether withdrawal vulnerabilities occur when a contract allows users to withdraw ether without proper authorization or checks, potentially leading to loss of funds or denial of service attacks.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate unprotected ether withdrawal vulnerabilities, implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can withdraw funds from the contract. Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern to handle fund transfers securely and prevent unauthorized withdrawals. Implement withdrawal limits and proper authorization checks to protect the contract's funds from malicious actors.
