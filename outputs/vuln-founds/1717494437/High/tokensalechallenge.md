### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks in the `sell` function. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to withdraw funds multiple times before the balance is updated, leading to potential loss of funds.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, ensure that state changes are made before any external calls. Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern where you first validate inputs, then update state variables, and finally interact with external contracts. Consider using the `withdraw` pattern to separate state changes from fund transfers. Additionally, consider using the `transfer` function with a limited gas stipend to prevent reentrancy attacks. 

### 2. **Integer Overflow/Underflow Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract is susceptible to integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities in the `buy` function. If the `numTokens` value is large enough, it can cause the `msg.value` calculation to overflow, leading to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To prevent integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities, consider using safe math libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to perform arithmetic operations safely. Implement checks to ensure that arithmetic operations do not result in overflow or underflow. Additionally, consider using a different approach for handling token purchases to avoid potential arithmetic issues.

### 3. **Unrestricted Ether Withdrawal**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract allows anyone to call the `sell` function and withdraw Ether without checking if the caller has sufficient tokens. This can lead to unauthorized Ether withdrawals and potential loss of funds.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement access control mechanisms to restrict Ether withdrawals to only users who have sufficient tokens. Use modifiers or require statements to ensure that the caller has the necessary balance before allowing the transfer of Ether. Consider implementing a withdrawal pattern where users explicitly request to withdraw their funds, rather than allowing automatic withdrawals based on function calls.
