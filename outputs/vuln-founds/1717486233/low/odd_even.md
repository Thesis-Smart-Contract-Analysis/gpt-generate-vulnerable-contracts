### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract does not handle the case where a player can call the `play` function multiple times before the `selectWinner` function is called. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially unfair outcomes.

**Locations:**

- In the `play` function:
  ```solidity
  players[count] = Player(msg.sender, number);
  count++;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, you can add additional logic to prevent a player from calling the `play` function multiple times before the `selectWinner` function is executed. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that only two players can participate in each round before selecting the winner.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract does not have a mechanism to handle tie scenarios where the sum of the numbers chosen by the players results in an even number. This can lead to funds being stuck in the contract without a clear resolution.

**Locations:**

- In the `selectWinner` function:
  ```solidity
  (bool success, ) = players[n%2].addr.call.value(address(this).balance)("");
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To address this vulnerability, you can add a condition to handle tie scenarios explicitly in the `selectWinner` function. This can involve refunding the players or implementing a tiebreaker mechanism to determine the winner in case of a tie.
