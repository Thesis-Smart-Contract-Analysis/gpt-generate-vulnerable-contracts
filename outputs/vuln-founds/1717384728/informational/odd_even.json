Additionally, you can add more validation checks to ensure fair play.\n\n### 2. **Vulnerability Type**\n\n**Severity:**\nInformational\n\n**Description:**\nThe contract does not have a way to handle tie scenarios where both players select the same number.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `selectWinner` function:\n  ```solidity\n  (bool success, ) = players[n%2].addr.call.value(address(this).balance)(\"\");\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo address tie scenarios, you can add logic to handle cases where both players select the same number, such as refunding the players or implementing a tiebreaker mechanism. It's essential to consider all possible outcomes and edge cases in the game logic.",
