### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract does not handle the case where players can manipulate the outcome by choosing numbers that result in the same remainder when added together.

**Locations:**

- In the `selectWinner` function:
  ```solidity
  uint n = players[0].number + players[1].number;
  (bool success, ) = players[n%2].addr.call.value(address(this).balance)("");
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, you can introduce additional randomness or a more secure way to determine the winner, such as using an oracle to provide a random number. Additionally, you can add more validation checks to ensure fair play.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract does not have a way to handle tie scenarios where both players select the same number.

**Locations:**

- In the `selectWinner` function:
  ```solidity
  (bool success, ) = players[n%2].addr.call.value(address(this).balance)("");
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To address tie scenarios, you can add logic to handle cases where both players select the same number, such as refunding the players or implementing a tiebreaker mechanism. It's essential to consider all possible outcomes and edge cases in the game logic.
