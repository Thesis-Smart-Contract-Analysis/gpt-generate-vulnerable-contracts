Additionally, ensure that the state changes are made before the external call to prevent reentrancy attacks.\n\n### 2. **Vulnerability Type**\n\n**Severity:**\nMedium\n\n**Description:**\nPotential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the winning number.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `selectWinner` function:\n  ```solidity\n  uint n = players[0].number + players[1].number;\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate integer overflow vulnerabilities, consider using safe math libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to perform arithmetic operations safely. Ensure that all arithmetic operations are checked for potential overflows before proceeding with the calculations.",
