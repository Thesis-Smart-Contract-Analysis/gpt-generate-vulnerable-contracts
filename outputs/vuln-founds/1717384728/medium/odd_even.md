### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
Potential reentrancy vulnerability due to the use of external calls in the `selectWinner` function.

**Locations:**

- In the `selectWinner` function:
  ```solidity
  (bool success, ) = players[n%2].addr.call.value(address(this).balance)("");
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using the `transfer` function instead of `call.value` to send Ether to the winner. Additionally, ensure that the state changes are made before the external call to prevent reentrancy attacks.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
Potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the winning number.

**Locations:**

- In the `selectWinner` function:
  ```solidity
  uint n = players[0].number + players[1].number;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate integer overflow vulnerabilities, consider using safe math libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to perform arithmetic operations safely. Ensure that all arithmetic operations are checked for potential overflows before proceeding with the calculations.
