### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract does not handle the case where players can manipulate the sum of their chosen numbers to always result in the same winner, potentially leading to unfair outcomes.

**Locations:**

- In the `selectWinner` function:
  ```solidity
  uint n = players[0].number + players[1].number;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, you can introduce randomness or a more complex logic to determine the winner based on the sum of the chosen numbers. Consider using an oracle or a commit-reveal scheme to ensure fairness in selecting the winner.
