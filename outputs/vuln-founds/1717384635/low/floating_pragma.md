### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The pragma solidity version is not locked, which can lead to potential issues when the contract is compiled with different compiler versions.

**Locations:**

- In the smart contract:
  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Lock the pragma solidity version to a specific version to ensure the contract is compiled consistently with the same compiler version. For example, use `pragma solidity 0.4.25;` to specify the exact version.
