### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The pragma solidity version is not specified with a fixed version, leaving the contract vulnerable to potential issues with future compiler versions.

**Locations:**

- In the contract:
  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Specify a fixed version of the Solidity compiler in the pragma statement to ensure the contract is compiled with a specific compiler version that has been thoroughly tested and known to work correctly with the contract code. For example, use `pragma solidity 0.4.25;` to lock the compiler version.
