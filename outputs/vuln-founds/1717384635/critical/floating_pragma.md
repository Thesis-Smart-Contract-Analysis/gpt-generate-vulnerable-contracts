### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Critical

**Description:**
The pragma solidity version is not locked, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities due to unexpected behavior of the compiler in future versions.

**Locations:**

- In the smart contract:
  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Lock the pragma solidity version to a specific version to prevent unexpected behavior caused by compiler upgrades. For example, use `pragma solidity 0.4.25;` to specify the exact version. This ensures that the contract will be compiled using the specified version of the Solidity compiler, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities due to compiler changes.
