### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The pragma solidity version is not locked, which can lead to potential issues with compatibility and security vulnerabilities in the future.

**Locations:**

- In the smart contract:
  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
