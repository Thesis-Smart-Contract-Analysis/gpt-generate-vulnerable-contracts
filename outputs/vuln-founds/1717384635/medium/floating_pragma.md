### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The pragma solidity version is not locked, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities due to unexpected behavior when the contract is compiled with different compiler versions.

**Locations:**

- In the smart contract:
  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Lock the pragma solidity version to a specific version to ensure consistency and predictability in contract compilation. Update the pragma statement to a specific version that has been thoroughly tested and verified for compatibility with the contract code. For example, use `pragma solidity ^0.4.24;` to specify a fixed version.
