### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The visibility of the functions `withdrawWinnings` and `_sendWinnings` is not explicitly specified, making them public by default. This can lead to potential security risks as unintended users may be able to call these functions.

**Locations:**

- In the function `withdrawWinnings`:
  ```solidity
  function withdrawWinnings() {
      require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
      _sendWinnings();
  }
  ```

- In the function `_sendWinnings`:
  ```solidity
  function _sendWinnings() {
      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Explicitly specify the visibility of functions to reduce the attack surface. Consider making functions `internal` or `private` if they are not intended to be called externally. Additionally, implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can call these functions.
