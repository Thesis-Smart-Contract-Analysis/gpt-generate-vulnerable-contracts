### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Critical

**Description:**
The lack of visibility modifiers in the functions `withdrawWinnings` and `_sendWinnings` makes them publicly accessible, allowing anyone to call these functions and potentially manipulate the contract state or funds.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function withdrawWinnings() {
      require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
      _sendWinnings();
  }
  ```

- In the `_sendWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function _sendWinnings() {
      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Explicitly specify the visibility modifiers for functions to restrict access. Use `external` if the function should only be called from outside the contract, or `internal` if the function should only be called from within the contract. Additionally, consider using access control mechanisms such as modifiers to restrict function access based on specific conditions or roles.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Critical

**Description:**
The use of `this.balance` in the `_sendWinnings` function to transfer funds can lead to re-entrancy vulnerabilities if the recipient contract is not trusted. Re-entrancy attacks can occur if the recipient contract calls back into the sending contract before completing the transfer, potentially allowing malicious actors to drain funds.

**Locations:**

- In the `_sendWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function _sendWinnings() {
      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Avoid using `this.balance` directly for transferring funds. Instead, implement a withdrawal pattern where users can withdraw their funds in a separate step. Use checks-effects-interactions pattern to ensure that the transfer of funds is the last operation in the function and consider using a withdrawal pattern with a separate accounting mechanism to handle fund transfers securely.
