### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The visibility of the functions `withdrawWinnings` and `_sendWinnings` is not explicitly defined, making them public by default. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities as unintended users may be able to call these functions.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function withdrawWinnings() {
      require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
      _sendWinnings();
  }
  ```

- In the `_sendWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function _sendWinnings() {
      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Explicitly define the visibility of functions to ensure they are only accessible by authorized users. Use `external`, `internal`, `private`, or `public` keywords based on the intended access level. Additionally, consider implementing access control mechanisms to restrict function calls to authorized addresses.
