This can lead to potential vulnerabilities as unintended users may be able to call these functions.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function withdrawWinnings() {\n      require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);\n      _sendWinnings();\n  }\n  ```\n\n- In the `_sendWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function _sendWinnings() {\n      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);\n  }\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nExplicitly define the visibility of functions to ensure they are only accessible by authorized users. Use `external`, `internal`, `private`, or `public` keywords based on the intended access level. Additionally, consider implementing access control mechanisms to restrict function calls to authorized addresses.",
