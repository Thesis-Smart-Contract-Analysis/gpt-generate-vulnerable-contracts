### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The visibility of the functions `withdrawWinnings` and `_sendWinnings` is not explicitly specified, making them public by default. This can lead to potential security risks as unintended users may be able to call these functions.

**Locations:**

- In the function `withdrawWinnings`:
  ```solidity
  function withdrawWinnings() {
      require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
      _sendWinnings();
  }
  ```

- In the function `_sendWinnings`:
  ```solidity
  function _sendWinnings() {
      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Explicitly specify the visibility of functions to ensure they are only accessible by authorized users. Consider using `internal` or `private` visibility modifiers based on the intended access level of the functions.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The contract uses the `this.balance` property to transfer funds in the `_sendWinnings` function. It is recommended to use the `address(this).balance` syntax instead for better clarity and to adhere to best practices.

**Locations:**

- In the function `_sendWinnings`:
  ```solidity
  function _sendWinnings() {
      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Replace `this.balance` with `address(this).balance` to explicitly access the contract's balance. This change improves code readability and reduces the risk of confusion regarding the source of the balance being accessed.
