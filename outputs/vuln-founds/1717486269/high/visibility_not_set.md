### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The functions `withdrawWinnings` and `_sendWinnings` do not specify visibility (public, private, external, internal). By default, functions are public, which means they can be called by anyone, including other contracts. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities if sensitive functions are inadvertently made public.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function withdrawWinnings() {
  ```

- In the `_sendWinnings` function:
  ```solidity
  function _sendWinnings() {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Explicitly specify the visibility of functions to ensure they are not inadvertently made public. For sensitive functions that should not be accessible externally, use the `private` or `internal` visibility keywords. 

Example:
```solidity
function withdrawWinnings() private {
```
```solidity
function _sendWinnings() private {
```

By making these functions `private`, you restrict access to them only within the contract, enhancing security by preventing external calls that could potentially exploit vulnerabilities.
