        "content": "### 1. **Vulnerability Type**\n\n**Severity:**\nHigh\n\n**Description:**\nThe functions `withdrawWinnings` and `_sendWinnings` do not specify visibility (public, private, external, internal). By default, functions are public, which means they can be called by anyone, including other contracts. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities if sensitive functions are inadvertently made public.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `withdrawWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function withdrawWinnings() {\n  ```\n\n- In the `_sendWinnings` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function _sendWinnings() {\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nExplicitly specify the visibility of functions to ensure they are not inadvertently made public. For sensitive functions that should not be accessible externally, use the `private` or `internal` visibility keywords. \n\nExample:\n```solidity\nfunction withdrawWinnings() private {\n```\n```solidity\nfunction _sendWinnings() private {\n```\n\nBy making these functions `private`, you restrict access to them only within the contract, enhancing security by preventing external calls that could potentially exploit vulnerabilities.",
