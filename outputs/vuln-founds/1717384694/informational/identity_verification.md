### 1. **External Contract Interaction**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The `isContract` function uses assembly code to check if the given address is a contract by checking its `extcodesize`. This can potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the contract interacts with external contracts without proper validation.

**Locations:**

- In the `isContract` function:
  ```solidity
  assembly { size := extcodesize(addr) }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement additional checks and validations when interacting with external contracts. This can include using interfaces, carefully validating input parameters, and handling potential reentrancy issues. Additionally, consider using higher-level Solidity constructs to interact with external contracts whenever possible.
