However, relying solely on `extcodesize` for this check can be bypassed by certain types of contracts.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `isContract` function:\n  ```solidity\n  assembly { size := extcodesize(addr) }\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo enhance the security of the contract, consider using a combination of checks such as checking the code hash or implementing a more comprehensive contract verification mechanism. Additionally, consider adding additional checks or using a library like OpenZeppelin's `Address.sol` for more robust contract detection.",
