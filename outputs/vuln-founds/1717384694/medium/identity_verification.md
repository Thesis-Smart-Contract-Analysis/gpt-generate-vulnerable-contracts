### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The `isContract` function uses the `extcodesize` assembly operation to check if the given address is a contract. However, relying solely on `extcodesize` for this check can be bypassed by certain types of contracts.

**Locations:**

- In the `isContract` function:
  ```solidity
  assembly { size := extcodesize(addr) }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To enhance the security of the contract, consider using a combination of checks such as checking the code hash or implementing a more comprehensive contract verification mechanism. Additionally, consider adding additional checks or using a library like OpenZeppelin's `Address.sol` for more robust contract detection.
