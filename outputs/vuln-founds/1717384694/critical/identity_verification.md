### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Critical

**Description:**
The `isContract` function does not have a modifier to restrict access to only externally owned accounts, allowing potential reentrancy attacks.

**Locations:**

- In the `isContract` function:
  ```solidity
  assembly { size := extcodesize(addr) }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, you should add a modifier to the function that restricts access to only externally owned accounts. Additionally, consider using the "check-effects-interactions" pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.
