### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The `isContract` function uses assembly code to check if the given address is a contract. This can potentially lead to false positives or negatives due to the limitations of the extcodesize opcode.

**Locations:**

- In the `isContract` function:
  ```solidity
  assembly { size := extcodesize(addr) }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider using alternative methods to check for contract addresses, such as the `CODESIZE` opcode or interface detection. Additionally, provide proper validation checks to handle edge cases and prevent unexpected behavior.
