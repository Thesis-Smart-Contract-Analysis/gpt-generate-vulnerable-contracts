This can potentially lead to false positives or negatives due to the limitations of the extcodesize opcode.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `isContract` function:\n  ```solidity\n  assembly { size := extcodesize(addr) }\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nConsider using alternative methods to check for contract addresses, such as the `CODESIZE` opcode or interface detection. Additionally, provide proper validation checks to handle edge cases and prevent unexpected behavior.",
