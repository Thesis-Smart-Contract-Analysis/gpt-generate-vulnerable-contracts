        "content": "### 1. **Vulnerability Type**\n\n**Severity:**\nHigh\n\n**Description:**\nThe `isContract` function uses the `extcodesize` assembly operation to check if the given address is a contract. This method is not foolproof and can be manipulated by attackers to bypass the check.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `isContract` function:\n  ```solidity\n  assembly { size := extcodesize(addr) }\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a combination of techniques such as verifying the code hash of the contract or using a combination of `extcodesize` and `codehash` checks to increase the security of the contract verification process. Additionally, consider using higher-level Solidity constructs whenever possible to reduce the reliance on low-level assembly operations.",
