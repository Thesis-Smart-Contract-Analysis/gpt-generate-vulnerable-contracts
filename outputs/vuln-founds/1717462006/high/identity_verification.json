This method is not reliable for detecting contract addresses and can be manipulated by attackers to bypass intended functionality.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `isContract` function:\n  ```solidity\n  assembly { size := extcodesize(addr) }\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo improve the contract's security, consider using a more robust method to check if an address is a contract. One common approach is to use the `CODESIZE` opcode in EVM bytecode. Additionally, consider implementing additional checks or using libraries that provide more secure ways to determine if an address is a contract.",
