### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The `isContract` function uses inline assembly to check if the given address is a contract. Using inline assembly can introduce security risks if not implemented correctly.

**Locations:**

- In the `isContract` function:
  ```solidity
  assembly { size := extcodesize(addr) }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Avoid using inline assembly unless absolutely necessary, as it can introduce complexities and potential vulnerabilities. Instead, consider using Solidity native functions or libraries to achieve the same functionality in a safer manner.
