Using inline assembly can introduce security risks if not implemented correctly.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `isContract` function:\n  ```solidity\n  assembly { size := extcodesize(addr) }\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nAvoid using inline assembly unless absolutely necessary, as it can introduce complexities and potential vulnerabilities. Instead, consider using Solidity native functions or libraries to achieve the same functionality in a safer manner.",
