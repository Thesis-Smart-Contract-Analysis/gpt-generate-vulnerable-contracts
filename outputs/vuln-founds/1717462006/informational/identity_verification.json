This can potentially lead to issues when interacting with external contracts.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `isContract` function:\n  ```solidity\n  assembly { size := extcodesize(addr) }\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nIt is recommended to use higher-level Solidity constructs for interacting with external contracts, such as using the `interface` keyword to define the expected interface of the external contract. This can help in preventing unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.",
