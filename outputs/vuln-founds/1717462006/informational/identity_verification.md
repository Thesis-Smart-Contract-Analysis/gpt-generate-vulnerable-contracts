### 1. **External Contract Interaction**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The `isContract` function uses assembly code to check if the given address is a contract by checking its `extcodesize`. This can potentially lead to issues when interacting with external contracts.

**Locations:**

- In the `isContract` function:
  ```solidity
  assembly { size := extcodesize(addr) }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
It is recommended to use higher-level Solidity constructs for interacting with external contracts, such as using the `interface` keyword to define the expected interface of the external contract. This can help in preventing unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
