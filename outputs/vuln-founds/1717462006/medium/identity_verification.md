### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The `isContract` function does not have a visibility modifier, making it publicly accessible. This can potentially expose the contract to unauthorized access or manipulation.

**Locations:**

- In the `isContract` function:
  ```solidity
  function isContract(address addr) returns (bool) {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Add a visibility modifier to the `isContract` function to restrict access to only authorized entities. Consider using `internal` or `private` depending on the intended functionality.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The `extcodesize` assembly call is used to check if the given address is a contract. However, relying solely on `extcodesize` for this check may not be sufficient as it can be manipulated by attackers to bypass the check.

**Locations:**

- In the `isContract` function:
  ```solidity
  assembly { size := extcodesize(addr) }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider implementing additional checks or mechanisms to enhance the security of the contract verification process. For example, you can combine `extcodesize` with other checks or use more advanced techniques like code hash verification to improve the contract detection mechanism.
