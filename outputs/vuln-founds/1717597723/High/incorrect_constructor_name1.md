### 1. **Incorrect Constructor Name**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The constructor function in Solidity should have the same name as the contract. In this contract, the constructor function is named `missing` instead of `Missing`, which can lead to confusion and potential vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  function missing() public {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Rename the `missing` function to `Missing` to match the contract name. This will ensure that the function acts as the constructor and is executed only once during contract deployment.

### 2. **Direct Ether Transfer**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `withdraw` function in the contract directly transfers Ether to the `owner` using `owner.transfer(this.balance)`. Directly transferring Ether to an address can be risky as it may fail if the receiving contract does not have enough gas to handle the transfer, potentially locking funds in the contract.

**Locations:**

- In the `withdraw` function:
  ```solidity
  owner.transfer(this.balance);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Use a withdrawal pattern where the recipient initiates the withdrawal to an external address. This can be achieved by keeping track of the user's balance within the contract and allowing them to withdraw funds instead of the contract initiating the transfer. Additionally, consider using a withdrawal pattern that allows for gradual withdrawals to prevent potential denial-of-service attacks.
