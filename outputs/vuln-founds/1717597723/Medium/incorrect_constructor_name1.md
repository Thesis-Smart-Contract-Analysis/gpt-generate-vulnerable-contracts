### 1. **Incorrect Constructor Name**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The constructor function in the smart contract has a different name than the contract itself, which can lead to confusion and potential vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the contract definition:
  ```solidity
  contract Missing {
  ```

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  function missing() public {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this issue, ensure that the constructor function has the same name as the contract. Use the `constructor` keyword in Solidity version 0.4.22 and above to explicitly define the constructor function. This helps in making the code more readable and reduces the chances of errors related to constructor invocation. 

Example:
```solidity
contract Missing {
    address private owner;

    modifier onlyowner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function() payable {}

    function withdraw() public onlyowner {
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```
