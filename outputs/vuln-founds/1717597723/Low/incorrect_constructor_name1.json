        "content": "### 1. **Incorrect Constructor Name**\n\n**Severity:**\nLow\n\n**Description:**\nThe constructor function in the smart contract has a different name than the contract itself, which can lead to confusion and potential issues during contract deployment and initialization.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the contract definition:\n  ```solidity\n  contract Missing {\n  ```\n\n- In the constructor function:\n  ```solidity\n  function missing() public {\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo mitigate this issue, ensure that the constructor function has the same name as the contract itself. Use the `constructor` keyword in Solidity version 0.6.0 and above to explicitly define the constructor function. This helps in improving code readability and avoiding confusion during deployment. \n\nExample:\n```solidity\ncontract Missing {\n    address private owner;\n\n    constructor() public {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    // Other functions remain the same\n}\n```\n\nBy following this convention, you can make the code more maintainable and reduce the risk of errors related to contract initialization.",
