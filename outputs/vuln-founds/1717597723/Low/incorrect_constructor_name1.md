### 1. **Incorrect Constructor Name**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The constructor function in the smart contract has a different name than the contract itself, which can lead to confusion and potential issues during contract deployment and initialization.

**Locations:**

- In the contract definition:
  ```solidity
  contract Missing {
  ```

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  function missing() public {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this issue, ensure that the constructor function has the same name as the contract itself. Use the `constructor` keyword in Solidity version 0.6.0 and above to explicitly define the constructor function. This helps in improving code readability and avoiding confusion during deployment. 

Example:
```solidity
contract Missing {
    address private owner;

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Other functions remain the same
}
```

By following this convention, you can make the code more maintainable and reduce the risk of errors related to contract initialization.
