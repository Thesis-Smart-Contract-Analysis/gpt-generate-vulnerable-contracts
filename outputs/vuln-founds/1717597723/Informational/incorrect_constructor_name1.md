### 1. **Incorrect Constructor Name**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The constructor function in the smart contract has a different name than the contract itself, which can lead to confusion and potential issues during contract deployment and initialization.

**Locations:**

- In the contract definition:
  ```solidity
  contract Missing {
  ```

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  function missing() public {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To avoid confusion and adhere to best practices, ensure that the constructor function has the same name as the contract. Rename the `missing()` function to `Missing()` to match the contract name.

### 2. **Deprecated Solidity Version**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The smart contract is written in Solidity version 0.4.24, which is outdated and may lack the latest security features and optimizations available in newer versions of Solidity.

**Locations:**

- Solidity version declaration:
  ```solidity
  pragma solidity 0.4.24;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider upgrading the Solidity version to the latest stable release to leverage the latest security enhancements, optimizations, and features provided by the Solidity development team. This can help improve the overall security and efficiency of the smart contract.
