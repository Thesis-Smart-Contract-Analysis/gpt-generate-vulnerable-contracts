Rename the `missing()` function to `Missing()` to match the contract name.\n\n### 2. **Deprecated Solidity Version**\n\n**Severity:**\nInformational\n\n**Description:**\nThe smart contract is written in Solidity version 0.4.24, which is outdated and may lack the latest security features and optimizations available in newer versions of Solidity.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- Solidity version declaration:\n  ```solidity\n  pragma solidity 0.4.24;\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nConsider upgrading the Solidity version to the latest stable release to leverage the latest security enhancements, optimizations, and features provided by the Solidity development team. This can help improve the overall security and efficiency of the smart contract.",
