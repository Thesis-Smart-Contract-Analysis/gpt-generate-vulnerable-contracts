Consider using the `call.value().gas().data()` syntax for more explicit control and error handling.\n\n### 2. **Vulnerability Type**\n\n**Severity:**\nMedium\n\n**Description:**\nThe vulnerability is due to using the low-level `call` function without specifying the amount of gas to be sent along with the call. This can lead to out-of-gas errors or unexpected behavior.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `callnotchecked` function:\n  ```solidity\n  callee.call();\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nExplicitly specify the amount of gas to be sent along with the call using `callee.call.gas(amount)()`. Ensure that an appropriate amount of gas is provided to prevent out-of-gas errors.",
