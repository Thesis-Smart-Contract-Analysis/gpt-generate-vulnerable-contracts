### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The vulnerability arises from not checking the return value of the `call` function, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of the `call` function and handle any potential errors appropriately to prevent unexpected behavior. Consider using the `call.value().gas().data()` syntax for more explicit control and error handling.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The vulnerability is due to using the low-level `call` function without specifying the amount of gas to be sent along with the call. This can lead to out-of-gas errors or unexpected behavior.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Explicitly specify the amount of gas to be sent along with the call using `callee.call.gas(amount)()`. Ensure that an appropriate amount of gas is provided to prevent out-of-gas errors.
