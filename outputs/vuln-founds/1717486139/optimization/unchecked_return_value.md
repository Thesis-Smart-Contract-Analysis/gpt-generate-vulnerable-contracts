### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Critical

**Description:**
The `call` function in Solidity can be used to call external contracts, and if not handled properly, it can lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities where an external contract can call back into the current contract before the first call is completed.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, ensure that external calls are made as the last operation in the function and use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern to separate state changes from external calls.

### 2. **Unchecked Return Value Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `call` function returns a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the external call. In the `callnotchecked` function, the return value of the `call` function is not checked, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the external call fails.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of external calls to handle potential failures appropriately. Use `require` or `if` statements to validate the return value and revert the transaction if the call fails.
