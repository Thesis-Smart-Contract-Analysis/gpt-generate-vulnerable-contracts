### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The `callnotchecked` function in the smart contract allows for an external contract to call back into the `ReturnValue` contract before the current function completes, potentially leading to reentrancy vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, ensure that external calls are made after all internal state changes are completed. Implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern to separate state changes from external calls.

### 2. **Unchecked Return Value**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The `callnotchecked` function does not check the return value of the external call, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of external calls to handle potential errors or failures gracefully. Use the `call` function in combination with the `require` statement to handle failed external calls appropriately.
