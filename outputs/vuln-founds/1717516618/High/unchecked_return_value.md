### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `callnotchecked` function in the smart contract allows for potential reentrancy attacks as the external contract `callee` is called without any checks or state modifications after the call. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, ensure that external calls are made as the last operation in a function and implement checks and state modifications before and after the call to prevent reentrancy attacks. Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern to minimize the risk of reentrancy. Consider using the `reentrancyGuard` modifier or similar patterns to protect against reentrancy attacks.

### 2. **Unchecked Return Value Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `callchecked` function in the smart contract uses the `require` statement with the `callee.call()` function, but it does not check the return value of the external call. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities if the external call fails or reverts, as the contract execution will not be halted.

**Locations:**

- In the `callchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  require(callee.call());
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of external calls to handle potential failures or reverts properly. Use `require` or `assert` statements to validate the return value of external calls and handle errors gracefully. Consider implementing error handling mechanisms to revert state changes and provide appropriate feedback to users in case of failed external calls.
