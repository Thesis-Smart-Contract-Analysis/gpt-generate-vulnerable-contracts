### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The `callnotchecked` function in the smart contract does not check the return value of the `callee.call()` function, which can potentially lead to a reentrancy vulnerability. If the callee contract executes a fallback function that calls back to the `ReturnValue` contract, it could result in unexpected behavior.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, always check the return value of external calls and perform state changes before making external calls. Implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern to ensure that state changes are completed before making external calls. Additionally, consider using the reentrancy guard modifier to prevent reentrancy attacks.
