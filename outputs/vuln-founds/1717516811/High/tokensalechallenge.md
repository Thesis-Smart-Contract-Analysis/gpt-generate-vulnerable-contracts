### 1. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow when performing arithmetic operations on unsigned integers. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities, you should use safe math libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to perform arithmetic operations. These libraries provide functions that revert the transaction if an overflow or underflow is detected, ensuring the integrity of the calculations.

### 2. **Unprotected Ether Withdrawal**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `sell` function allows users to withdraw Ether without checking if the contract has enough balance to cover the withdrawal. This can lead to a scenario where the contract runs out of Ether and is unable to fulfill withdrawal requests.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate the risk of running out of Ether, you should implement a withdrawal pattern where the contract keeps track of the total Ether balance and only allows withdrawals up to the available balance. Additionally, consider using the pull payment pattern to let users withdraw their funds instead of automatically transferring Ether to them in the contract logic.
