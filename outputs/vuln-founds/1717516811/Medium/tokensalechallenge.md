### 1. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract is vulnerable to integer overflow and underflow when performing arithmetic operations on unsigned integers. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities, you should use safe arithmetic functions provided by libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath. These functions perform checks to prevent overflow and underflow errors. It is recommended to replace direct arithmetic operations with SafeMath functions to ensure secure calculations.

### 2. **Unprotected Ether Transfer**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract uses `transfer` to send Ether to an address without checking the return value. This can lead to a vulnerability where the recipient contract may reject the Ether transfer, causing the transaction to fail and leaving the sender with locked funds.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate the risk of failed Ether transfers, you should use the `send` or `transfer` functions along with proper error handling. It is recommended to check the return value of the transfer operation and handle failure cases appropriately, such as reverting the transaction if the transfer fails. Additionally, consider using more robust patterns like the Withdrawal Pattern to allow users to withdraw funds securely.
