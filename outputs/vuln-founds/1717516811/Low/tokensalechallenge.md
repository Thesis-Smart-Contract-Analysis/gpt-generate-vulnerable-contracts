### 1. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
Integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities can occur when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum or goes below the minimum value that the data type can hold. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities, you can use safe math libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to perform arithmetic operations safely. These libraries provide functions that check for overflows and underflows before executing the operation, preventing vulnerabilities associated with integer arithmetic.

### 2. **Reentrancy**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
Reentrancy vulnerabilities occur when a contract's function can be called repeatedly before the previous call completes, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the contract's state and funds unexpectedly.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, you should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Ensure that state changes are made before interacting with external contracts or transferring funds. Additionally, consider using the withdrawal pattern to separate state changes from fund transfers, reducing the risk of reentrancy attacks.
