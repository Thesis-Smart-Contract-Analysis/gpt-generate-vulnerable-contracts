### 1. **Reentrancy**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks in the `sell` function. An attacker can call the `sell` function and then re-enter the function before the state changes are finalized, potentially draining the contract's balance.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern to ensure that state changes are finalized before interacting with external contracts. Use the `transfer` function as the last operation in the function after updating the contract state.

### 2. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract is susceptible to integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities in the `buy` function. If the `numTokens` value is large enough, the multiplication `msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN` can overflow, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Use safe math libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to prevent integer overflow/underflow issues. Implement checks to ensure that arithmetic operations cannot result in values that exceed the expected range.

### 3. **Unprotected Ether Withdrawal**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract allows users to withdraw Ether using the `transfer` function without proper checks. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities if the contract balance is drained unexpectedly.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement a withdrawal pattern where users can withdraw their funds in a controlled manner. Consider using the Withdrawal Pattern or the Pull-Payment Pattern to ensure secure and controlled fund withdrawals.
