### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract does not check for potential integer overflow when calculating the total value of tokens to be purchased in the `buy` function.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the multiplication operation does not result in an integer overflow. Consider using SafeMath library functions for arithmetic operations to prevent overflow vulnerabilities.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract does not handle the case where the `sell` function could potentially fail due to insufficient contract balance to transfer the tokens back to the sender.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, you should first check if the contract has enough balance to transfer the tokens back to the sender before executing the transfer. Implement a check to ensure that the contract balance is sufficient to cover the transfer amount before proceeding with the transfer operation.
