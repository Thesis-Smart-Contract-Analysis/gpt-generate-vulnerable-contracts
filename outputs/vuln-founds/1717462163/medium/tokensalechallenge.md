### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the `sell` function. This vulnerability allows an attacker to call back into the contract before the state is updated, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate the reentrancy vulnerability, ensure that state changes are made before any external calls. Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern where you first validate inputs, update state variables, and then interact with external contracts or transfer funds. Consider using the `withdraw` pattern to separate state changes from external calls.
