### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in the `sell` function. This vulnerability allows an attacker to call back into the contract before the state is updated, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate the reentrancy vulnerability, ensure that state changes are made before any external calls. Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern where you first validate inputs, then update state variables, and finally interact with external contracts or users.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract is susceptible to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack in the `buy` function. An attacker can drain the contract's funds by repeatedly calling the `buy` function with a large `numTokens` value, causing the contract to run out of ether.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To prevent DoS attacks, consider implementing a limit on the number of tokens that can be purchased in a single transaction. Additionally, you can introduce a circuit breaker mechanism to temporarily disable the `buy` function in case of an attack.

### 3. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the `buy` and `sell` functions. This can lead to unauthorized token transfers and manipulation of balances.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` and `sell` functions:
  ```solidity
  function buy(uint256 numTokens) public payable {
  function sell(uint256 numTokens) public {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement access control mechanisms such as modifiers to restrict the execution of critical functions to only authorized addresses. Consider using the OpenZeppelin library for standardized access control solutions like `onlyOwner` or `onlyAdmin` modifiers.

### 4. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The contract uses a fixed price per token (`PRICE_PER_TOKEN`) which is hardcoded in the contract. This can lead to issues if the price needs to be adjusted in the future, as the contract would need to be redeployed.

**Locations:**

- In the contract declaration:
  ```solidity
  uint256 constant PRICE_PER_TOKEN = 1 ether;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider making the token price configurable, either by allowing the owner to set the price or by integrating with an external price oracle. This flexibility ensures that the contract can adapt to changing market conditions without requiring a redeployment.
