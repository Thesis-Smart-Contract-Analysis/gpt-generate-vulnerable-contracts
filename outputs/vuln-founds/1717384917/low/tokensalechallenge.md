### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract does not check for integer overflow when calculating the total value of tokens to be purchased in the `buy` function. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities if the multiplication result exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, you should consider using safe math libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to perform arithmetic operations and prevent integer overflows. Ensure that all arithmetic operations are checked for potential overflows before proceeding with the calculations.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract does not handle the scenario where the `sell` function might fail due to insufficient contract balance to transfer the tokens back to the sender. This can result in a denial-of-service vulnerability where users are unable to sell their tokens and retrieve their funds.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To address this vulnerability, you should implement a check to ensure that the contract has sufficient balance to transfer the tokens back to the sender before executing the transfer. Additionally, consider using a withdrawal pattern where users can withdraw their funds instead of relying on automatic transfers in the contract.
