### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `sell` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks as the `msg.sender.transfer` is called before updating the balance of the sender. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls back the `sell` function repeatedly before the balance is updated, draining the contract's balance.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy attacks, ensure that state changes are made before any external calls. Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern where you first validate inputs, then update state variables, and finally interact with external contracts. Consider using the `transfer` method as the last operation in the function after updating the balance.

### 2. **Integer Overflow/Underflow Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `buy` function is vulnerable to integer overflow/underflow attacks as there is no check to prevent overflow when calculating `msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN`. An attacker can manipulate the `numTokens` value to cause an overflow, resulting in unexpected behavior.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement checks to prevent integer overflow/underflow by using safe math libraries or explicitly checking for potential overflow conditions before performing arithmetic operations. Consider using libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to handle arithmetic operations safely.

### 3. **Unprotected Ether Withdrawal**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The contract allows anyone to call the `sell` function to withdraw Ether without checking if the sender has enough tokens. This can lead to a scenario where a user can withdraw more Ether than they should be entitled to.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only users with sufficient token balances can withdraw Ether. Consider using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern to update the sender's balance before transferring Ether. Implement a modifier to check if the sender has enough tokens before allowing the transfer of Ether.
