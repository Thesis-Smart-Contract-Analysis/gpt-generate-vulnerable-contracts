### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Critical

**Description:**
The `sell` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks as the contract's state is modified after the transfer of funds to the caller. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls back into the `sell` function before the state is updated, allowing them to withdraw funds multiple times.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate reentrancy attacks, ensure that state modifications are done before transferring funds. Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern where you first update the state, then transfer funds. Consider using the `withdraw` pattern to separate state changes from fund transfers.

### 2. **Integer Overflow/Underflow Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Critical

**Description:**
The `buy` function is vulnerable to integer overflow/underflow attacks as it does not check for potential overflow/underflow when calculating the total value of tokens to be purchased.

**Locations:**

- In the `buy` function:
  ```solidity
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement checks to prevent integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities. Use SafeMath library functions for arithmetic operations to handle overflow/underflow conditions safely.

### 3. **Unprotected Ether Withdrawal**

**Severity:**
Critical

**Description:**
The contract allows anyone to call the `sell` function to withdraw Ether without checking if the caller has sufficient tokens. This can lead to unauthorized Ether withdrawals.

**Locations:**

- In the `sell` function:
  ```solidity
  msg.sender.transfer(numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement access control mechanisms to restrict Ether withdrawals to only authorized users. Use modifiers or require statements to ensure that only users with sufficient tokens can withdraw Ether. Consider implementing a withdrawal pattern to separate withdrawal logic from other contract functions.
