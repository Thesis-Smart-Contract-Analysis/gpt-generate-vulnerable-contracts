### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The constructor function is defined using the old style constructor syntax, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities as it is not the recommended way to define constructors in Solidity.

**Locations:**

- In the function `Example`:
  ```solidity
  function Example() public {
    admin = address(0x0);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Use the constructor keyword to define constructors in Solidity to ensure compatibility with newer compiler versions and avoid potential vulnerabilities associated with the old style constructor syntax.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `admin` variable is being initialized with the address 0x0 in the `Example` function, which might not be the intended behavior and could lead to unexpected consequences.

**Locations:**

- In the function `Example`:
  ```solidity
  function Example() public {
    admin = address(0x0);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Ensure that the `admin` variable is initialized with a valid and intended address to prevent potential issues related to using address(0x0) as the initial value.
