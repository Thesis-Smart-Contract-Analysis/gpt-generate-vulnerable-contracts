### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The constructor function is defined using the old style constructor syntax, which can lead to confusion and potential vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the function `Example`:
  ```solidity
  function Example() public {
    admin = address(0x0);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Use the constructor keyword instead of the function name to define the constructor. This will make the code clearer and less error-prone.

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Medium

**Description:**
The `admin` variable is declared as public, which exposes it to potential manipulation by external actors.

**Locations:**

- Variable declaration:
  ```solidity
  address public admin;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider making the `admin` variable private and implementing appropriate access control mechanisms to restrict access and modification to authorized users only.
