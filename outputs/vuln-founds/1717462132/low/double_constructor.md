### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The constructor function is defined using the old style constructor syntax, which is considered deprecated in Solidity versions after 0.4.22. This can lead to confusion and potential issues during contract deployment.

**Locations:**

- In the `Example` function:
  ```solidity
  function Example() public {
    admin = address(0x0);
  }
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Use the constructor keyword to define the constructor function explicitly. This ensures clarity and compatibility with newer Solidity versions. 

### 2. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The `admin` variable is declared as public, which exposes it to potential manipulation by external contracts. It is generally recommended to keep variables private unless there is a specific reason for them to be public.

**Locations:**

- Variable declaration:
  ```solidity
  address public admin;
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider changing the visibility of the `admin` variable to private to restrict direct access from external contracts. Provide appropriate getter functions if necessary to access the variable's value.
