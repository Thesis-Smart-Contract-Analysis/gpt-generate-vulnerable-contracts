It can lead to potential exploits in the contract.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the constructor function:\n  ```solidity\n  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo improve randomness, consider using an external oracle or Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) for secure random number generation. Avoid using block-related data for randomness as it can be manipulated.",
