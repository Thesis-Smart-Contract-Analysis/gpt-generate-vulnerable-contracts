### 1. **Use of `keccak256` for Random Number Generation**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
Using `keccak256` for generating random numbers can be predictable and manipulable by miners or attackers.

**Locations:**

- In the constructor function:
  ```solidity
  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To improve randomness, consider using an external oracle or Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) for generating random numbers securely. Avoid using block-related data for random number generation in smart contracts.

### 2. **Lack of Access Control**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the `guess` function and potentially drain the contract's balance.

**Locations:**

- In the `guess` function:
  ```solidity
  function guess(uint8 n) public payable {
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement access control mechanisms such as `onlyOwner` modifier or role-based access control to restrict who can call sensitive functions like `guess`. This will prevent unauthorized users from interacting with critical parts of the contract.
