Avoid using block-related data for random number generation in smart contracts.\n\n### 2. **Lack of Access Control**\n\n**Severity:**\nLow\n\n**Description:**\nThe contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the `guess` function and potentially drain the contract's balance.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the `guess` function:\n  ```solidity\n  function guess(uint8 n) public payable {\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nImplement access control mechanisms such as `onlyOwner` modifier or role-based access control to restrict who can call sensitive functions like `guess`. This will prevent unauthorized users from interacting with critical parts of the contract.",
