This can lead to a front-running attack where miners can influence the result of the random number generation.\n\n**Locations:**\n\n- In the constructor function:\n  ```solidity\n  answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));\n  ```\n\n**Mitigation:**\nTo improve randomness, consider using an external oracle or a verifiable random function (VRF) to generate random numbers securely. Avoid using block-related data for randomness in smart contracts.",
