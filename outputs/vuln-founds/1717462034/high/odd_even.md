### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `selectWinner` function allows for a potential reentrancy vulnerability as it performs an external call to transfer funds before updating the state variables. An attacker could potentially exploit this by having a fallback function in their contract that calls back into the `OddEven` contract before the state is updated, allowing them to re-enter the `selectWinner` function and potentially drain funds.

**Locations:**

- In the `selectWinner` function:
  ```solidity
  (bool success, ) = players[n%2].addr.call.value(address(this).balance)("");
  ```

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. Ensure that state changes are made before any external calls are performed. Consider using the `transfer` or `send` functions instead of `call.value` to transfer funds, as they limit the gas forwarded to prevent reentrancy attacks. Additionally, consider using withdrawal patterns to separate the transfer of funds from updating the state variables.
