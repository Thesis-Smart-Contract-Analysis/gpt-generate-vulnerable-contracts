### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The `callnotchecked` function in the smart contract does not check the return value of the `callee.call()` function, which can potentially lead to a reentrancy vulnerability.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of external calls and perform necessary state changes before making the external call to prevent reentrancy attacks. Consider using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern to mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities.

### 2. **Gas Limit Exhaustion Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
Low

**Description:**
The `callchecked` function in the smart contract uses `require(callee.call())`, which consumes all available gas if the external call fails. This can potentially lead to gas limit exhaustion vulnerabilities.

**Locations:**

- In the `callchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  require(callee.call());
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Consider using a gas stipend or implementing a gas limit check to prevent gas exhaustion vulnerabilities. Ensure that the contract design allows for graceful handling of out-of-gas scenarios.
