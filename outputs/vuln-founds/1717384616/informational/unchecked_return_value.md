### 1. **Vulnerability Type**

**Severity:**
Informational

**Description:**
The use of `address.call()` without checking the return value can lead to potential vulnerabilities as it does not provide any feedback on the success or failure of the external call.

**Locations:**

- In the function `callnotchecked`:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
It is recommended to use the `call.value()` function along with checking the return value to handle potential errors and ensure the safety of the contract. Additionally, consider using more modern patterns like the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.
