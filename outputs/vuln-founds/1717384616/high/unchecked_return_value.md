### 1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `callnotchecked` function in the smart contract does not check the return value of the `call` function, which can lead to a reentrancy vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to re-enter the contract and manipulate its state.

**Locations:**

- In the `callnotchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  callee.call();
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Always check the return value of external calls and perform state modifications before making external calls to prevent reentrancy attacks. Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern where you first validate inputs, then update state variables, and finally interact with external contracts.

### 2. **Unrestricted Ether Withdrawal**

**Severity:**
High

**Description:**
The `callchecked` function in the smart contract allows the callee to withdraw Ether without any restrictions. This can lead to Ether being transferred to malicious contracts or addresses without proper authorization.

**Locations:**

- In the `callchecked` function:
  ```solidity
  require(callee.call());
  ```

**Mitigation:**
Implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can withdraw Ether from the contract. Use the "pull" over "push" pattern for Ether withdrawals, where users initiate the withdrawal process themselves. Implement checks to ensure that only authorized addresses can withdraw Ether from the contract.
