```solidity
// Smart contract vulnerable to Denial of Service with Block Gas Limit

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DoSBlockGasLimit {
    
    mapping(uint => uint) public data;

    function addToData(uint _index, uint _value) public {
        data[_index] = _value;
    }

    function consumeGas() public {
        for (uint i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            data[i] = i;
        }
    }
}
```

In the smart contract `DoSBlockGasLimit` above, the `consumeGas` function contains a loop that iterates 100,000 times and writes to the `data` mapping. This can consume a significant amount of gas and potentially exceed the block gas limit, causing a denial of service for other transactions on the Ethereum network.

### Remediation:

To mitigate the Denial of Service with Block Gas Limit vulnerability, you can consider the following remediation techniques:

1. **Gas Limit Check**: Implement a gas limit check within functions that involve loops or potentially high gas consumption operations. This check can prevent the function from consuming excessive gas and causing a DoS attack.

2. **Gas Optimization**: Optimize the gas consumption of the smart contract by reducing unnecessary operations or loops. Try to minimize gas usage wherever possible to avoid hitting the block gas limit.

3. **Batch Processing**: If the operation involves processing a large amount of data, consider implementing batch processing techniques to split the work into smaller chunks that can be processed over multiple transactions.

4. **Gas Refund**: If applicable, consider implementing gas refund mechanisms to return unused gas to the user, reducing the overall gas cost of transactions.

By implementing these remediation techniques, you can reduce the risk of Denial of Service attacks due to block gas limit exhaustion in your smart contract.
