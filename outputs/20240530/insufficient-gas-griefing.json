        "content": "Below is a vulnerable smart contract that exhibits the Insufficient Gas Griefing vulnerability:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract GasGriefing {\n    address public owner;\n    uint public balance;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can transfer ownership\");\n        owner = _newOwner;\n    }\n\n    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can withdraw funds\");\n        require(_amount <= balance, \"Insufficient balance\");\n        \n        // Vulnerable code: Revert without consuming all gas\n        revert(\"Withdrawal reverted\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the `withdraw` function of the `GasGriefing` contract, the contract reverts with a message without consuming all the gas available. This can be exploited by an attacker to perform a griefing attack by repeatedly calling the `withdraw` function with a small amount of gas, causing the owner to waste gas fees without actually withdrawing any funds.\n\n### Remediation:\nTo mitigate the Insufficient Gas Griefing vulnerability, you can update the `withdraw` function to consume all available gas before reverting. One common approach is to use a gas stipend to forward the remaining gas to a trusted contract or address before reverting. Here is an example of how you can remediate the vulnerability:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract GasGriefingFixed {\n    address public owner;\n    uint public balance;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can transfer ownership\");\n        owner = _newOwner;\n    }\n\n    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can withdraw funds\");\n        require(_amount <= balance, \"Insufficient balance\");\n        \n        // Consume all gas before reverting\n        address payable trustedAddress = payable(owner);\n        selfdestruct(trustedAddress);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the remediated `withdraw` function, the contract forwards all remaining gas to the owner's address using `selfdestruct` before reverting. This ensures that the gas is fully consumed before the revert occurs, preventing the gas griefing attack."
