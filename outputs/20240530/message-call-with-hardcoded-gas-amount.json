        "content": "Below is a vulnerable smart contract that has the Message Call with Hardcoded Gas Amount vulnerability:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MessageCallVulnerable {\n    address public owner;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function transferFunds(address payable _recipient, uint _amount) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can transfer funds\");\n        \n        // Vulnerable message call with hardcoded gas amount\n        (bool success, ) = _recipient.call{value: _amount, gas: 50000}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the `transferFunds` function of the smart contract `MessageCallVulnerable`, there is a vulnerable message call using `call` with a hardcoded gas amount of 50,000. Hardcoding the gas amount in a message call can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if the gas provided is not sufficient for the operation to be completed successfully.\n\n### Remediation:\n\nTo remediate the vulnerability, it is recommended to avoid hardcoding gas amounts in message calls. Instead, use the `gas` parameter dynamically based on the gas available in the transaction. Here is an updated version of the smart contract with the vulnerability remediated:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract MessageCallFixed {\n    address public owner;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function transferFunds(address payable _recipient, uint _amount) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can transfer funds\");\n        \n        // Fixed message call with dynamic gas amount\n        (bool success, ) = _recipient.call{value: _amount, gas: gasleft()}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the remediated version, the `gas` parameter in the message call is set dynamically using `gasleft()`, which returns the amount of gas left for the current transaction. This ensures that the message call has enough gas to complete the operation successfully without hardcoding a specific gas amount."
