# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BaseContract {
    function baseFunction() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Base function";
    }
}

contract ChildContract is BaseContract, AnotherBaseContract {
    function childFunction() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Child function";
    }
}

contract AnotherBaseContract {
    function anotherBaseFunction() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Another base function";
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the above smart contract is the Incorrect Inheritance Order. In the `ChildContract`, the order of inheritance is `BaseContract` followed by `AnotherBaseContract`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as the functions and variables from `AnotherBaseContract` may not be accessible or may override those from `BaseContract`.

# Remediations

- To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the order of inheritance in the `ChildContract` is correct, with the base contracts listed in the desired priority order. In this case, `BaseContract` should be inherited after `AnotherBaseContract` to maintain the intended behavior.
- Always carefully consider the order of inheritance to avoid conflicts and ensure the expected functionality of the smart contract.
