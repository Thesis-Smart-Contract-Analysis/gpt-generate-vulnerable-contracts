# Smart contract

```solidity
// Integer Overflow/Underflow vulnerability
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IntegerOverflowUnderflow {
    uint8 public maxValue = 255;

    function add(uint8 a, uint8 b) public view returns (uint8) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability lies in the `add` function where two `uint8` inputs are added together. Since the maximum value that a `uint8` can hold is 255, if the sum of `a` and `b` exceeds this value, an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially exploit the contract.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Implement input validation to check for potential overflow/underflow before performing arithmetic operations. One way to do this is by using SafeMath library functions that handle arithmetic operations safely.
- Remediation 2: Use larger integer types like `uint256` if the expected result of the arithmetic operation may exceed the maximum value of smaller types like `uint8`. This ensures that the calculations can accommodate a wider range of values without risking overflow.
