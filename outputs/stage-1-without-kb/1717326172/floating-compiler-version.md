# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract FloatingCompilerVersionVulnerability {
    uint private value;

    constructor(uint _value) {
        value = _value;
    }

    function updateValue(uint _newValue) public {
        value = _newValue;
    }

    function getValue() public view returns (uint) {
        return value;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the pragma statement specifying the compiler version as `^0.8.0`. This version range allows the compiler to use any version greater than or equal to `0.8.0` but less than `0.9.0`. This flexibility can lead to inconsistencies in the compiled bytecode when different compiler versions are used during testing and deployment.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Specify an exact compiler version in the pragma statement to ensure consistency in compilation. For example, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;` instead of `^0.8.0`.
- Remediation 2: Implement a continuous integration (CI) pipeline that enforces a specific compiler version for compiling the smart contract code. This ensures that the same compiler version is used throughout the development and deployment process.
