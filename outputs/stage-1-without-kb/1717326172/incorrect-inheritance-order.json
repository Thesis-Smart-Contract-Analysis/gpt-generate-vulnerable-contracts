In the `ChildContract`, the order of inheritance is `BaseContract` followed by `AnotherBaseContract`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as the functions and variables from `AnotherBaseContract` may not be accessible or may override those from `BaseContract`.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the order of inheritance in the `ChildContract` is correct, with the base contracts listed in the desired priority order. In this case, `BaseContract` should be inherited after `AnotherBaseContract` to maintain the intended behavior.\n- Always carefully consider the order of inheritance to avoid conflicts and ensure the expected functionality of the smart contract.",

The first part of the smart contract has a Incorrect Inheritance Order vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
