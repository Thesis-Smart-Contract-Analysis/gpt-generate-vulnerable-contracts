If the external call to `_recipient` fails intentionally or unintentionally, it can lead to a denial of service attack. An attacker can repeatedly call this function with a malicious `_recipient` address that causes the contract to become unresponsive due to the failed external calls.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Use the `transfer` function instead of `call` for transferring funds to ensure that the transaction reverts in case of failure, preventing a denial of service attack. Here's an updated version of the `transferFunds` function:\n\n```solidity\nfunction transferFunds(address payable _recipient, uint _amount) public {\n    require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the contract owner can transfer funds\");\n    _recipient.transfer(_amount);\n}\n```\n\n- Implement a circuit breaker mechanism in the smart contract to allow the contract owner to pause the functionality of transferring funds in case of a potential denial of service attack. This can help mitigate the impact of repeated failed calls to external addresses.",

Trong trường hợp kẻ tấn công gọi đến bên ngoài smart contract nhiều lần trong cùng một giao dịch, smart contract có thể trở nên không khả dụng.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Denial of Service with Failed Call vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
