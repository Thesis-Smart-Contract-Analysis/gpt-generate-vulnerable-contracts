# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IncorrectConstructorName {
    address public owner;

    function MyContract() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the constructor function declaration. In Solidity versions prior to 0.4.22, the constructor function should have the same name as the contract itself to be recognized as a constructor. In this case, the constructor function is named `MyContract` instead of `IncorrectConstructorName`, which means it will not be treated as a constructor but as a regular function that can be called by anyone.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Rename the function to match the contract name to ensure it is recognized as a constructor.
- **Remediation 2:** Use the `constructor` keyword introduced in Solidity version 0.4.22 and later to explicitly define the constructor function, regardless of the name of the function. This ensures clarity and prevents the vulnerability. 

By following these remediations, you can mitigate the Incorrect Constructor Name vulnerability and enhance the security of the smart contract.
