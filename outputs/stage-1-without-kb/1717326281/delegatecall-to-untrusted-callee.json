However, the `trustedCallee` address is not necessarily trusted, and this can lead to potential security risks. The external contract called via `delegatecall` can manipulate the state variables of the calling contract, posing a threat to the integrity and security of the system.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1:** Avoid using `delegatecall` with external contracts that are not fully trusted. Instead, consider using `call` or `staticcall` depending on the requirements of the interaction.\n  \n- **Remediation 2:** Implement a proxy contract pattern where the external contract's functions are explicitly defined and controlled within the proxy contract. This way, only specific functions can be invoked, reducing the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Delegatecall to Untrusted Callee vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nViệc sử dụng hàm `delegatecall` để gọi hàm của các smart contract không tin cậy là rất nguy hiểm bởi vì các smart contract này có thể thay đổi các giá trị của các biến trạng thái hoặc chiếm quyền sở hữu của smart contract hiện tại.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Delegatecall to Untrusted Callee vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
