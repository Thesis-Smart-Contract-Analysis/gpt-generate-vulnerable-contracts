# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TypoVulnerableContract {
    uint public totalSupply;

    constructor(uint _initialSupply) {
        totalSupply = _initialSupply;
    }

    function mint(uint _amount) public {
        totalSuply += _amount; // Typo in variable name 'totalSuply'
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

There is a Typographical Error vulnerability in the `mint` function where the variable `totalSuply` is mistakenly used instead of `totalSupply`. This typo can lead to unintended behavior in the smart contract, potentially affecting the total token supply management.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Correct the typo in the `mint` function by using the correct variable name `totalSupply` to ensure accurate tracking of the total token supply.
- Remediation 2: Implement thorough code reviews and testing practices to catch such typographical errors before deployment to prevent vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
