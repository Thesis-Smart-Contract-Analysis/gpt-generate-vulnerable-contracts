This can lead to a Short Address vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate the input data to be shorter than expected, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1: Implement a check for the correct length of the address data before assigning it to the `owner` variable. You can use the following modifier to ensure the address length is as expected:\n\n```solidity\nmodifier validAddressLength(address _address) {\n    require(_address == address(uint160(_address)), \"Invalid address length\");\n    _;\n}\n```\n\nThen, modify the constructor as follows:\n\n```solidity\nconstructor(address _owner) validAddressLength(_owner) {\n    owner = _owner;\n}\n```\n\n- Remediation 2: Use the `bytes` type to receive the address input and then convert it to an `address` type. This way, you can explicitly check the length of the input data before converting it to an address. Here's an example of how you can modify the constructor:\n\n```solidity\nconstructor(bytes memory _owner) {\n    require(_owner.length == 20, \"Invalid address length\");\n    owner = address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(_owner))));\n}\n```",

Cụ thể hơn, nó liên quan đến việc hợp đồng thông minh sử dụng đối số có kiểu là địa chỉ (`address`) nhưng không thực hiện kiểm tra độ dài của dữ liệu giao dịch.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Short Address vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
