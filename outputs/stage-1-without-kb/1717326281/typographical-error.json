This typo can lead to unintended behavior in the smart contract, potentially affecting the total token supply management.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1: Correct the typo in the `mint` function by using the correct variable name `totalSupply` to ensure accurate tracking of the total token supply.\n- Remediation 2: Implement thorough code reviews and testing practices to catch such typographical errors before deployment to prevent vulnerabilities in smart contracts.",

The first part of the smart contract has a Typographical Error vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
