# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    address public trustedCallee;

    constructor(address _trustedCallee) {
        trustedCallee = _trustedCallee;
    }

    function executeDelegateCall(bytes memory _data) public {
        (bool success, ) = trustedCallee.delegatecall(_data); // Line with Delegatecall to Untrusted Callee vulnerability
        require(success, "Delegatecall failed");
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the `executeDelegateCall` function where it uses `delegatecall` to invoke a function on an external contract specified by the `trustedCallee` address. However, the `trustedCallee` address is not necessarily trusted, and this can lead to potential security risks. The external contract called via `delegatecall` can manipulate the state variables of the calling contract, posing a threat to the integrity and security of the system.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Avoid using `delegatecall` with external contracts that are not fully trusted. Instead, consider using `call` or `staticcall` depending on the requirements of the interaction.
  
- **Remediation 2:** Implement a proxy contract pattern where the external contract's functions are explicitly defined and controlled within the proxy contract. This way, only specific functions can be invoked, reducing the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities.
