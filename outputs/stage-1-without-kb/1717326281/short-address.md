# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ShortAddressVulnerable {
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _owner) {
        owner = _owner; // line 6
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in line 6 where the assignment of the `_owner` address to the `owner` variable does not check the length of the input address data. This can lead to a Short Address vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate the input data to be shorter than expected, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the contract.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Implement a check for the correct length of the address data before assigning it to the `owner` variable. You can use the following modifier to ensure the address length is as expected:

```solidity
modifier validAddressLength(address _address) {
    require(_address == address(uint160(_address)), "Invalid address length");
    _;
}
```

Then, modify the constructor as follows:

```solidity
constructor(address _owner) validAddressLength(_owner) {
    owner = _owner;
}
```

- Remediation 2: Use the `bytes` type to receive the address input and then convert it to an `address` type. This way, you can explicitly check the length of the input data before converting it to an address. Here's an example of how you can modify the constructor:

```solidity
constructor(bytes memory _owner) {
    require(_owner.length == 20, "Invalid address length");
    owner = address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(_owner))));
}
```
