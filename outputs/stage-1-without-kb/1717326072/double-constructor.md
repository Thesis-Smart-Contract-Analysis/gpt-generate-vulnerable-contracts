# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.22;

contract DoubleConstructorVulnerability {
    uint public data;

    function DoubleConstructorVulnerability() public {
        data = 100;
    }

    constructor() public {
        data = 200;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract above is the presence of two constructors with different names but serving the same purpose. In Solidity version 0.4.22, a smart contract can have both a constructor function with the same name as the contract and a constructor function named `constructor`. The constructor function defined first will be executed, leading to ambiguity and potential unexpected behavior.

# Remediations

- To fix the Double Constructor vulnerability, it is recommended to remove one of the constructor functions and consolidate the initialization logic into a single constructor. This ensures clarity and avoids confusion regarding which constructor will be executed.
- Alternatively, if you need to support different constructor behaviors based on conditions, consider using a factory pattern or initializing function that can handle the logic based on parameters passed during contract deployment. This approach can help maintain code readability and reduce the risk of unintended behavior.
