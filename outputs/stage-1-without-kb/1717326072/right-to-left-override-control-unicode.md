# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    string public fileName;

    constructor(string memory _fileName) {
        fileName = _fileName;
    }

    function updateFileName(string memory _newFileName) public {
        fileName = _newFileName;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

The vulnerability lies in the `updateFileName` function where an attacker can exploit the Right-To-Left Override Control Character vulnerability by inserting the character U+202E to manipulate the display order of characters in the `_newFileName` parameter. This can lead to misleading or deceptive file names being displayed to users.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Implement input validation in the `updateFileName` function to ensure that the `_newFileName` parameter does not contain any control characters, including the Right-To-Left Override Control Character (U+202E). You can use regular expressions or character validation checks to prevent such characters from being accepted.

- **Remediation 2:** Use libraries or functions that sanitize input data to remove or neutralize any potentially harmful characters before processing or displaying them. By sanitizing the input, you can prevent the exploitation of control characters like U+202E and maintain the integrity of displayed file names.
