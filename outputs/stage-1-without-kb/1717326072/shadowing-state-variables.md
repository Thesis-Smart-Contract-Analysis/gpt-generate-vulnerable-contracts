# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ParentContract {
    uint256 public data = 100;
}

contract ChildContract is ParentContract {
    uint256 public data = 200; // Line with Shadowing State Variables vulnerability
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract arises from the ChildContract declaring a state variable `data` that shadows the same state variable name declared in the ParentContract. This can lead to confusion and unintended behavior as the ChildContract's `data` variable will hide the ParentContract's `data` variable, potentially causing unexpected results.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Avoid using the same variable names in child contracts that are already declared in parent contracts. Use unique variable names to prevent shadowing and maintain clarity in the code.
- Remediation 2: If the intention is to override the parent contract's variable, consider using function overrides or explicitly defining the variable as `override` in the child contract to make the behavior explicit and prevent unintentional shadowing.
