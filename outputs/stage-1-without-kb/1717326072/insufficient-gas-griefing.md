# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract InsufficientGasGriefing {
    function callAnotherContract(address _contractAddress) external {
        (bool success, ) = _contractAddress.call{gas: 10000}("");
        require(success, "Call to another contract failed");
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability lies in the `callAnotherContract` function where the smart contract does not check if it has enough gas to call another contract. By specifying a very low amount of gas (10000 in this case), an attacker can intentionally provide insufficient gas to cause the call to another contract to fail, leading to incorrect outcomes in the smart contract.

# Remediations

- Use gas stipend or estimate gas: Instead of hardcoding a specific gas amount, use gas stipend or estimate gas required for the external call to ensure that there is enough gas for the operation to be successful.
- Implement gas checks: Before making an external call, check the gas remaining using `gasleft()` and ensure that there is sufficient gas for the operation to prevent the Insufficient Gas Griefing vulnerability.
