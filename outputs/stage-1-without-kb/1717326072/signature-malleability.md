# Smart contract

contract SignatureMalleabilityVulnerable {
    function verifySignature(bytes32 message, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s, address signer) public pure returns (bool) {
        bytes memory prefix = "\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32";
        bytes32 prefixedHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(prefix, message));
        
        address recoveredSigner = ecrecover(prefixedHash, v, r, s);

    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the `verifySignature` function where the `ecrecover` function is used to recover the signer's address from the provided signature parameters (v, r, s). The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `v` value can be manipulated by an attacker to create a different but valid signature without knowing the private key, exploiting the signature malleability issue.

# Remediations

- One way to mitigate the Signature Malleability vulnerability is to enforce a specific `v` value range in the smart contract. By restricting the `v` value to be either 27 or 28, we can prevent attackers from manipulating the signature to create different valid signatures.
  
- Another approach is to normalize the `v` value within the smart contract by calculating it based on the parity of the `recoveredSigner` address. This normalization ensures that the `v` value is always consistent and eliminates the malleability vulnerability.
