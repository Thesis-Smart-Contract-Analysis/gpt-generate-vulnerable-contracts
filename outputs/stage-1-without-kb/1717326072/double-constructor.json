In Solidity version 0.4.22, a smart contract can have both a constructor function with the same name as the contract and a constructor function named `constructor`. The constructor function defined first will be executed, leading to ambiguity and potential unexpected behavior.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- To fix the Double Constructor vulnerability, it is recommended to remove one of the constructor functions and consolidate the initialization logic into a single constructor. This ensures clarity and avoids confusion regarding which constructor will be executed.\n- Alternatively, if you need to support different constructor behaviors based on conditions, consider using a factory pattern or initializing function that can handle the logic based on parameters passed during contract deployment. This approach can help maintain code readability and reduce the risk of unintended behavior.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Double Constructor vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nTại phiên bản 0.4.22, smart contract có thể sử dụng cùng lúc hai loại hàm tạo: hàm tạo trùng tên với smart contract và hàm tạo có tên là `constructor`. Hàm tạo nào được định nghĩa trước sẽ được thực thi.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Double Constructor vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
