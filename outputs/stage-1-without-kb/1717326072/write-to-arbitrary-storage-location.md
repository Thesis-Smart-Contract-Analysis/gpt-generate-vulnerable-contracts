# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function writeToArbitraryStorage(address _target, uint256 _value) public {
        uint256 slot = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_target)));
        assembly {
            sstore(slot, _value)
        }
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the `writeToArbitraryStorage` function where it calculates the storage slot based on the hash of the `_target` address. This allows an attacker to write to any storage slot in the contract, potentially modifying sensitive data and bypassing access controls.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Avoid using dynamic or unpredictable values to calculate storage slots. Instead, use predefined and controlled mappings or variables to store sensitive data.
  
- **Remediation 2:** Implement proper access control mechanisms to restrict write access to specific storage locations. Utilize modifiers or require statements to ensure that only authorized users or contracts can modify sensitive data.
