# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ShortAddressVulnerable {
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _owner) {
        owner = _owner; // line 6
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in line 6 where the contract assigns the `_owner` address directly to the `owner` variable without validating the length of the address data. This can lead to a Short Address vulnerability where an attacker can craft a transaction with a shorter address than expected, causing the EVM to pad the address with zeros. This can potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security risks.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Implement a check to ensure that the address passed as an argument has the correct length before assigning it to the `owner` variable. You can use the following code snippet to validate the address length:

```solidity
require(_owner == address(uint160(_owner)), "Invalid address length");
owner = _owner;
```

- Remediation 2: Use the `address` type directly in the function parameter to leverage the built-in length validation provided by Solidity. This way, Solidity will automatically revert the transaction if an address with an incorrect length is passed.

```solidity
constructor(address _owner) {
    owner = _owner;
}
```
