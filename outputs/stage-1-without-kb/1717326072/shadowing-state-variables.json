This can lead to confusion and unintended behavior as the ChildContract's `data` variable will hide the ParentContract's `data` variable, potentially causing unexpected results.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1: Avoid using the same variable names in child contracts that are already declared in parent contracts. Use unique variable names to prevent shadowing and maintain clarity in the code.\n- Remediation 2: If the intention is to override the parent contract's variable, consider using function overrides or explicitly defining the variable as `override` in the child contract to make the behavior explicit and prevent unintentional shadowing.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Shadowing State Variables vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nXảy ra khi một smart contract kế thừa smart contract khác và cả hai đều cùng khai báo một biến. Vấn đề này cũng xảy ra khi smart contract có một biến toàn cục trùng tên với một biến cục bộ ở trong hàm.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Shadowing State Variables vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
