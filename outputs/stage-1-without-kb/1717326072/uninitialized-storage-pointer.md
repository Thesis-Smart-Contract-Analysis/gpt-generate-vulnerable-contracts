# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UninitializedStoragePointer {
    uint256 private data;

    function updateData() public {
        uint256 temp;
        data = temp; // line 8
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in line 8, where a local variable `temp` of type `uint256` is declared but not initialized before assigning its value to the state variable `data`. Since `temp` is not initialized, it may contain arbitrary data from the storage, leading to potential unintended modification of the state variable `data`.

# Remediations

- Ensure that all local variables are properly initialized before use to avoid pointing to uninitialized storage slots.
- Use explicit initialization for local variables to prevent them from inadvertently referencing storage variables.
