By specifying a very low amount of gas (10000 in this case), an attacker can intentionally provide insufficient gas to cause the call to another contract to fail, leading to incorrect outcomes in the smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Use gas stipend or estimate gas: Instead of hardcoding a specific gas amount, use gas stipend or estimate gas required for the external call to ensure that there is enough gas for the operation to be successful.\n- Implement gas checks: Before making an external call, check the gas remaining using `gasleft()` and ensure that there is sufficient gas for the operation to prevent the Insufficient Gas Griefing vulnerability.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Insufficient Gas Griefing vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nXảy ra khi smart contract không kiểm tra xem nó có đủ gas để gọi đến smart contract khác hay không. Kẻ tấn công có thể cung cấp thiếu gas nhằm khiến cho lời gọi đến smart contract khác bị thất bại và làm kết quả của smart contract bị sai lệch.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Insufficient Gas Griefing vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
