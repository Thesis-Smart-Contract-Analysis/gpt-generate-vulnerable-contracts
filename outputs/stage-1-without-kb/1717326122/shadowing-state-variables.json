Both the `ParentContract` and `ChildContract` declare a state variable named `data`. This can lead to confusion and unintended behavior as the child contract's `data` variable shadows the parent contract's `data` variable.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1: Avoid naming conflicts by using unique variable names across contracts. In this case, renaming the `data` variable in the `ChildContract` to something distinct would resolve the issue.\n- Remediation 2: Use inheritance carefully and ensure that state variables with the same name are intended to override each other. If not, consider refactoring the code to avoid such conflicts.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Shadowing State Variables vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nXảy ra khi một smart contract kế thừa smart contract khác và cả hai đều cùng khai báo một biến. Vấn đề này cũng xảy ra khi smart contract có một biến toàn cục trùng tên với một biến cục bộ ở trong hàm.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Shadowing State Variables vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
