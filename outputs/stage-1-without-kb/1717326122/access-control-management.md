# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract AccessControlVulnerability {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
        // Withdraw logic
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

The vulnerability in this smart contract lies in the `withdraw` function. The function does not properly control access, allowing anyone to call it and execute the withdrawal logic as long as they know the function signature.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Implement a modifier to restrict access to sensitive functions like `withdraw` to only the owner.
  
  ```solidity
  modifier onlyOwner() {
      require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function");
      _;
  }

  function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
      // Withdraw logic
  }
  ```

- **Remediation 2:** Use OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract to manage access control in a secure and standardized way.
  
  ```solidity
  import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

  contract AccessControlFixed is Ownable {
      function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
          // Withdraw logic
      }
  }
  ```

By implementing one of the suggested remediations, you can mitigate the Access Control Management vulnerability in the smart contract and ensure that only the owner can execute sensitive functions like `withdraw`.
