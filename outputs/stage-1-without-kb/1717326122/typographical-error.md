# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TypoVulnerableContract {
    uint public balance;

    function deposit(uint _amount) public {
        blance += _amount; // Typo on this line
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

There is a Typographical Error vulnerability in the `deposit` function of the smart contract. The variable `balance` is misspelled as `blance`, which will lead to unintended behavior as the intended balance update will not occur.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Correct the typo in the code to ensure the intended functionality:
  
  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  contract FixedTypoContract {
      uint public balance;

      function deposit(uint _amount) public {
          balance += _amount; // Corrected spelling of 'balance'
      }
  }
  ```

- Remediation 2: Use code review tools and IDE plugins that can help catch such typographical errors during development to prevent such vulnerabilities from making it into the deployed smart contracts.
