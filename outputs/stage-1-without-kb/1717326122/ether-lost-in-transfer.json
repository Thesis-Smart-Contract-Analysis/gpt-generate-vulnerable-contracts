This can lead to Ether being sent to orphan addresses, causing permanent loss of funds.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1:** Implement a withdrawal pattern where the contract owner initiates the withdrawal process and specifies the recipient address. This ensures that funds are only sent to intended addresses.\n- **Remediation 2:** Use the \"pull\" over \"push\" pattern for withdrawals, where users can withdraw their funds instead of the contract initiating transfers. This reduces the risk of Ether being sent to unintended addresses.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Ether Lost in Transfer vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nETH được chuyển vào các địa chỉ mồ côi (không gắn liền với bất kỳ người dùng hoặc smart contract nào) sẽ bị mất hoàn toàn.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Ether Lost in Transfer vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
