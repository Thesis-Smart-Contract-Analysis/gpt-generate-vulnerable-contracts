# Smart contract

```solidity
contract BaseContract {
    function baseFunction() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Base function";
    }
}

contract ChildContract is BaseContract, AnotherBaseContract {
    function childFunction() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Child function";
    }
}

contract AnotherBaseContract {
    function anotherBaseFunction() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Another base function";
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

The vulnerability in the above smart contract is the Incorrect Inheritance Order. In the `ChildContract`, the order of inheritance is `BaseContract` followed by `AnotherBaseContract`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as the functions and variables from `BaseContract` may not interact correctly with those from `AnotherBaseContract`.

# Remediations

- To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the order of inheritance in the `ChildContract` is correct and matches the intended behavior. In this case, `AnotherBaseContract` should be inherited before `BaseContract` to maintain the desired functionality.
- Always pay attention to the order of inheritance to avoid potential conflicts and ensure the proper functioning of the smart contract.
