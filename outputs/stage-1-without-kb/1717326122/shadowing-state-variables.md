# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ParentContract {
    uint256 public data = 100;
}

contract ChildContract is ParentContract {
    uint256 public data = 200; // Line with Shadowing State Variables vulnerability
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the above smart contract is the Shadowing State Variables issue. Both the `ParentContract` and `ChildContract` declare a state variable named `data`. This can lead to confusion and unintended behavior as the child contract's `data` variable shadows the parent contract's `data` variable.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Avoid naming conflicts by using unique variable names across contracts. In this case, renaming the `data` variable in the `ChildContract` to something distinct would resolve the issue.
- Remediation 2: Use inheritance carefully and ensure that state variables with the same name are intended to override each other. If not, consider refactoring the code to avoid such conflicts.
