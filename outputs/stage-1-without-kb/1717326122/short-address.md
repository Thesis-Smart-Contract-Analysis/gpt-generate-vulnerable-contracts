# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ShortAddressVulnerability {
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _owner) {
        owner = _owner;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the `transferOwnership` function where it fails to check the length of the `newOwner` address input. This can lead to a Short Address vulnerability where an attacker can craft a transaction with a shorter address than expected, causing the EVM to pad the address with zeros. This can potentially allow the attacker to manipulate the address comparison logic in the contract.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Implement a check to ensure that the length of the `newOwner` address is equal to the expected length (20 bytes for Ethereum addresses) before proceeding with the ownership transfer. This can prevent the Short Address vulnerability.
- Remediation 2: Use the `address` type in Solidity, which automatically checks the length of the address and throws an error if it is not the expected length. This can help mitigate the Short Address vulnerability.
