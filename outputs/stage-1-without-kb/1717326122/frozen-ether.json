This can lead to a situation where Ether gets locked inside the contract, making it inaccessible to the depositors.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Implement a withdrawal function that allows users to withdraw their deposited Ether. This function should reduce the user's balance before transferring the Ether to prevent re-entrancy attacks.\n- Consider using the Withdrawal Pattern or the Pull-Pattern to allow users to withdraw their Ether securely. This involves having users initiate the withdrawal process themselves to prevent potential vulnerabilities.",

The first part of the smart contract has a Frozen Ether vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
