In the `ChildContract`, the order of inheritance is `BaseContract` followed by `AnotherBaseContract`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as the functions and variables from `BaseContract` may not interact correctly with those from `AnotherBaseContract`.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the order of inheritance in the `ChildContract` is correct and matches the intended behavior. In this case, `AnotherBaseContract` should be inherited before `BaseContract` to maintain the desired functionality.\n- Always pay attention to the order of inheritance to avoid potential conflicts and ensure the proper functioning of the smart contract.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Incorrect Inheritance Order vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nDo mỗi smart contract cơ sở đều có độ ưu tiên, việc không quan tâm thứ tự kế thừa có thể dẫn đến những hành vi không mong muốn của smart contract.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Incorrect Inheritance Order vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
