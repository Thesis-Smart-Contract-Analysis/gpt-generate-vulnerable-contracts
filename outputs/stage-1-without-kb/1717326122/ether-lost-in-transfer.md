# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        address payable to = payable(msg.sender);
        to.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in this smart contract is on line 14, where the `withdraw` function allows anyone to call it and withdraw the contract's balance to their address. This can lead to Ether being sent to orphan addresses, causing permanent loss of funds.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Implement a withdrawal pattern where the contract owner initiates the withdrawal process and specifies the recipient address. This ensures that funds are only sent to intended addresses.
- **Remediation 2:** Use the "pull" over "push" pattern for withdrawals, where users can withdraw their funds instead of the contract initiating transfers. This reduces the risk of Ether being sent to unintended addresses.
