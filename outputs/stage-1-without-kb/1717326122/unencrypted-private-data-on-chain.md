# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UnencryptedPrivateData {
    uint256 private secretNumber;

    function setSecretNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public {
        secretNumber = _newNumber; // Line with Unencrypted Private Data On-Chain vulnerability
    }

    function getSecretNumber() public view returns (uint256) {
        return secretNumber;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the line where the `secretNumber` variable is being directly assigned a new value in the `setSecretNumber` function. Since the `secretNumber` variable is marked as `private`, it may give a false sense of security. However, any transaction calling the `setSecretNumber` function will be recorded on the blockchain, making the value of `secretNumber` publicly visible and susceptible to analysis by malicious actors.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Encrypt the sensitive data before storing it on-chain. Use encryption techniques such as asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA) or symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) to protect the confidentiality of the data.
- Remediation 2: Implement off-chain storage solutions for sensitive data. Store the private data off-chain in a secure database or use secure enclaves to handle sensitive information, ensuring that only authorized parties can access it.
