# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract FrozenEther {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() external payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() external {
        uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "Insufficient balance");
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in this smart contract lies in the fact that it allows users to deposit Ether into the contract but does not provide a function for them to withdraw their deposited Ether. This can lead to a situation where Ether gets locked inside the contract, making it inaccessible to the depositors.

# Remediations

- Implement a withdrawal function that allows users to withdraw their deposited Ether. This function should reduce the user's balance before transferring the Ether to prevent re-entrancy attacks.
- Consider using the Withdrawal Pattern or the Pull-Pattern to allow users to withdraw their Ether securely. This involves having users initiate the withdrawal process themselves to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
