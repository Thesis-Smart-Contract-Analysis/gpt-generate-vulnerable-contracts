# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UnencryptedPrivateData {
    uint private secretNumber;

    function setSecretNumber(uint _newNumber) public {
        secretNumber = _newNumber; // Line with Unencrypted Private Data On-Chain vulnerability
    }

    function getSecretNumber() public view returns (uint) {
        return secretNumber;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the line where the `secretNumber` variable is directly assigned a new value in the `setSecretNumber` function. Since Ethereum blockchain is transparent and all transactions are visible to the public, the value of `secretNumber` can be easily observed by anyone, compromising the privacy of this sensitive data.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Encrypt the sensitive data before storing it on-chain. Use encryption techniques such as asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA) or symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) to protect the confidentiality of the data.
- Remediation 2: Implement off-chain storage solutions for sensitive data. Store the private data off-chain in a secure database or use secure multi-party computation techniques to perform computations on private data without revealing the actual values on-chain.
