# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract FunctionSelectorClash {
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
        // Vulnerable line below
        require(msg.sender == _to);
        // End of vulnerable line
        return true;
    }
    
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
        require(msg.sender == _from);
        return true;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the `transfer` function where the `require(msg.sender == _to)` statement is used to ensure that the sender is the intended recipient of the transfer. However, due to the Function Selector Clashing vulnerability, an attacker can craft a transaction with a different function signature that results in the same first 4 bytes as the `transfer` function selector, leading to unintended execution of the `transfer` function.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1:** Implement function input validation to ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters. For example, you can add additional checks to verify the input parameters before executing the critical logic.

- **Remediation 2:** Use function modifiers to restrict access control and ensure that only authorized users can call specific functions. By implementing access control mechanisms, you can prevent unauthorized parties from invoking critical functions within the smart contract.
