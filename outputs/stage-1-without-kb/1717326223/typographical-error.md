# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TypoVulnerableContract {
    uint public balance;

    constructor() {
        balance = 1000;
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        balane -= _amount; // Typo on this line
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:

There is a Typographical Error vulnerability in the `withdraw` function of the smart contract. The line `balane -= _amount;` contains a typo where `balane` should be `balance`. This typo can lead to unintended behavior in the contract, potentially affecting the manipulation of the `balance` variable.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Review and double-check all variable names and function calls to ensure they are correctly spelled.
- Remediation 2: Implement automated code analysis tools to catch common typos and errors during the development process.
