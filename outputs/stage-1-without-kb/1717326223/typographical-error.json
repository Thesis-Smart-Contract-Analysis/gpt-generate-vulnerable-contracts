The line `balane -= _amount;` contains a typo where `balane` should be `balance`. This typo can lead to unintended behavior in the contract, potentially affecting the manipulation of the `balance` variable.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1: Review and double-check all variable names and function calls to ensure they are correctly spelled.\n- Remediation 2: Implement automated code analysis tools to catch common typos and errors during the development process.",

The first part of the smart contract has a Typographical Error vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
