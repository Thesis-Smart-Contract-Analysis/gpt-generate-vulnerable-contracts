This can lead to Ether being lost if the recipient address is a contract that does not handle received Ether properly.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Use the Withdrawal Pattern**: Implement a withdrawal pattern where users need to explicitly withdraw their funds instead of having a function that allows anyone to withdraw the contract's balance. This pattern ensures that only intended recipients can withdraw Ether from the contract.\n\n- **Check Recipient Address**: Before transferring Ether to an address, always check if the recipient is a valid and trusted address. Avoid sending Ether to unknown or untrusted contracts to prevent potential loss of funds.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Ether Lost in Transfer vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nETH được chuyển vào các địa chỉ mồ côi (không gắn liền với bất kỳ người dùng hoặc smart contract nào) sẽ bị mất hoàn toàn.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Ether Lost in Transfer vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
