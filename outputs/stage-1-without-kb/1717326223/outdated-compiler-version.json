Using an old compiler version can expose the contract to known vulnerabilities and issues that have been publicly disclosed.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1: Upgrade the compiler version to the latest stable version available at the time of deployment. This ensures that the smart contract benefits from the latest security patches and improvements.\n- Remediation 2: Regularly monitor and update the compiler version used for smart contract development to stay current with the latest advancements in the Solidity language and to mitigate potential security risks associated with outdated compiler versions.",

The first part of the smart contract has a Outdated Compiler Version vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
