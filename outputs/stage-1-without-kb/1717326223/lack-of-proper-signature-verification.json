This means that anyone can call this function and set themselves as the new owner without any authentication, leading to unauthorized ownership changes.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1: Implement a modifier to check the sender's identity before allowing ownership transfer. For example, you can create a modifier like `onlyOwner` that verifies the sender's address matches the current owner's address before proceeding with the ownership transfer.\n- Remediation 2: Utilize cryptographic signatures to ensure that only authorized parties can change the ownership. Require the new owner to sign a message containing the new owner address and verify the signature within the smart contract before updating the ownership.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Lack of Proper Signature Verification vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nXảy ra khi smart contract không thực hiện kiểm tra tính hợp lệ của chữ ký khi thực hiện những thao tác nhạy cảm. Kẻ tấn công có thể lợi dụng điều này để vượt qua xác thực nhằm thực hiện những hành vi không được phép.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Lack of Proper Signature Verification vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
