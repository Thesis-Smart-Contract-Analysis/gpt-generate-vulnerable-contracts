# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UninitializedStoragePointer {
    uint256 private data;

    function updateData() public {
        uint256 temp;
        data = temp; // line 8
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in line 8 where a local variable `temp` of type `uint256` is declared but not initialized before assigning its value to the state variable `data`. Since `temp` is uninitialized, it may point to an arbitrary location in storage, potentially overwriting unintended state variables.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Always initialize local variables before using them. In this case, initializing `temp` with a specific value before assigning it to `data` can prevent the uninitialized storage pointer vulnerability.
- Remediation 2: Use explicit data location specifiers when declaring variables to ensure clarity and avoid unintended storage pointer issues. For example, explicitly specify `uint256 temp = 0;` to initialize `temp` with a default value.
