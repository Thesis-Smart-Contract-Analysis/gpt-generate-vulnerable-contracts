# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract OutdatedCompiler {
    uint public data;

    function setData(uint _data) public {
        data = _data;
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in this smart contract is the use of an outdated compiler version (0.4.24). Using an old compiler version can expose the contract to known vulnerabilities and issues that have been publicly disclosed.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Upgrade the compiler version to the latest stable version available at the time of deployment. This ensures that the smart contract benefits from the latest security patches and improvements.
- Remediation 2: Regularly monitor and update the compiler version used for smart contract development to stay current with the latest advancements in the Solidity language and to mitigate potential security risks associated with outdated compiler versions.
