# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        owner = newOwner; // Lack of proper signature verification vulnerability on this line
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in the smart contract lies in the `transferOwnership` function where the contract allows changing the `owner` without proper signature verification. This means that anyone can call this function and set themselves as the new owner without any authentication, leading to unauthorized ownership changes.

# Remediations

- Remediation 1: Implement a modifier to check the sender's identity before allowing ownership transfer. For example, you can create a modifier like `onlyOwner` that verifies the sender's address matches the current owner's address before proceeding with the ownership transfer.
- Remediation 2: Utilize cryptographic signatures to ensure that only authorized parties can change the ownership. Require the new owner to sign a message containing the new owner address and verify the signature within the smart contract before updating the ownership.
