# Smart contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        address payable to = payable(msg.sender);
        to.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

Description of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract:
The vulnerability in this smart contract is on line 14, where the `withdraw` function allows anyone to withdraw the contract's balance to their address without any restrictions. This can lead to Ether being lost if the recipient address is a contract that does not handle received Ether properly.

# Remediations

- **Use the Withdrawal Pattern**: Implement a withdrawal pattern where users need to explicitly withdraw their funds instead of having a function that allows anyone to withdraw the contract's balance. This pattern ensures that only intended recipients can withdraw Ether from the contract.

- **Check Recipient Address**: Before transferring Ether to an address, always check if the recipient is a valid and trusted address. Avoid sending Ether to unknown or untrusted contracts to prevent potential loss of funds.
