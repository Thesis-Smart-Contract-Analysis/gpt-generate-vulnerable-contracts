However, using `tx.origin` for authentication is vulnerable to a potential attack where another contract can call the `transferOwnership` function and bypass the ownership check by manipulating the transaction origin.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1:** Use `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin` for authentication. `msg.sender` represents the direct caller of the function, which is a more secure way to authenticate the caller.\n- **Remediation 2:** Implement access control mechanisms such as OpenZeppelin's Ownable pattern or Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage ownership and permissions securely. These patterns provide a structured way to control access to functions within the smart contract.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Authorization through `tx.origin` vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nLỗ hổng này xảy ra khi smart contract dùng giá trị `tx.origin` để xác thực. Giá trị này là giá trị của địa chỉ thực hiện giao dịch và nếu smart contract A có gọi thực thi hàm của smart contract B thì smart contract B có thể vượt qua xác thực của smart contract A.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Authorization through `tx.origin` vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
