# Smart Contract

Here is an example of a smart contract in Solidity that demonstrates the Weak Sources of Randomness from Chain Attributes vulnerability:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract RandomNumberGame {
    uint private lastBlockNumber;
    bytes32 private lastBlockHash;

    // Event to emit the random number and winner status
    event RandomResult(uint randomNumber, bool isWinner);

    // Function to generate a random number based on vulnerable sources
    function generateRandomNumber() public returns (uint) {
        // Vulnerable line: using block attributes that can be influenced by miners
        uint randomNumber = uint(blockhash(block.number - 1)) % 100; // line 12
        bool isWinner = (randomNumber > 50);
        emit RandomResult(randomNumber, isWinner);
        return randomNumber;
    }
}
```

### Description of the Vulnerability in the Generated Smart Contract

The vulnerability in this contract arises from using `blockhash(block.number - 1)` as a source of randomness. The `blockhash` function returns the hash of the given block when the block number is one of the 256 most recent blocks, excluding the current block. Miners can potentially manipulate this by influencing the block's attributes (like the timestamp and the transactions included) to produce a favorable outcome, especially when stakes are high (e.g., in a gambling scenario). This manipulation can compromise the fairness and unpredictability of the game.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1: Use of External Oracle for Randomness**
  - Integrate an external oracle such as Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to obtain truly random and tamper-proof numbers. Chainlink VRF provides cryptographic proof of the randomness and integrity of the number supplied, ensuring that the result cannot be tampered with or predicted by any party, including miners.

- **Remediation 2: Commit-Reveal Scheme**
  - Implement a commit-reveal scheme that involves two phases; in the first phase, players submit a hash of their secret number and some unique data. In the second phase, they reveal their secrets, and the contract checks if the hashes match. The final random number can be derived by combining these secrets. This method ensures that no single participant can influence the outcome alone.

Both of these methods provide stronger guarantees of randomness and fairness, mitigating the risks associated with using blockchain attributes directly.
