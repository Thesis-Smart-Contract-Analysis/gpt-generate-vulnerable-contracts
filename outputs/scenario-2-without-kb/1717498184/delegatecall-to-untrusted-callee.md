# Smart Contract with Delegatecall to Untrusted Callee Vulnerability

Here is an example of a smart contract in Solidity that demonstrates the Delegatecall to Untrusted Callee vulnerability:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Vulnerable {
    address public owner;
    uint public someValue;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function setOwner(address _newOwner) public {
        owner = _newOwner;
    }

    function delegatecallSetOwner(address _target, bytes memory _data) public {
        // Vulnerability: Delegatecall to an untrusted target
        (bool success, ) = _target.delegatecall(_data); // line 16
        require(success, "Delegatecall failed");
    }
}

contract Malicious {
    address public owner;

    function maliciousSetOwner() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}
```

### Description of the Vulnerability in the Generated Smart Contract

In the `Vulnerable` contract, the `delegatecallSetOwner` function uses `delegatecall` to execute code at the address `_target` using the input data `_data`. The vulnerability arises because the contract does not verify whether `_target` is a trusted contract. This can lead to several issues:

1. If `_target` points to a malicious contract like `Malicious`, it can execute unintended code in the context of the `Vulnerable` contract.
2. Since `delegatecall` preserves the caller's context (storage, caller, etc.), the malicious contract can alter the state variables of the `Vulnerable` contract. For example, it could change the `owner` state variable to take over the contract.

# Remediations

To mitigate the risks associated with using `delegatecall` to an untrusted callee, consider the following remediations:

- **Remediation 1: Use Only Trusted Contracts**
  - Modify the `delegatecallSetOwner` function to ensure that only addresses from a list of pre-approved contracts can be called. This list should be managed and updated carefully by trusted parties only.

```solidity
function delegatecallSetOwner(address _target, bytes memory _data) public {
    require(isTrustedContract(_target), "Target not trusted");
    (bool success, ) = _target.delegatecall(_data);
    require(success, "Delegatecall failed");
}

mapping(address => bool) private trustedContracts;

function addTrustedContract(address _contract) public onlyOwner {
    trustedContracts[_contract] = true;
}

function removeTrustedContract(address _contract) public onlyOwner {
    trustedContracts[_contract] = false;
}

function isTrustedContract(address _contract) public view returns (bool) {
    return trustedContracts[_contract];
}
```

- **Remediation 2: Avoid Delegatecall When Possible**
  - If the functionality can be achieved without using `delegatecall`, consider alternative methods such as calling trusted contracts directly or using libraries. This avoids the risks associated with context preservation and unintended storage modifications.

By implementing these remediations, the contract can be safeguarded against unintended or malicious alterations of its state through the misuse of `delegatecall` to untrusted contracts.
