# Smart Contract with Built-in Symbol Shadowing Vulnerability

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SymbolShadowingExample {
    uint256 public gas = 10; // line 6: Vulnerability - shadowing built-in global variable 'gas'

    function setGas(uint256 _gas) public {
        gas = _gas; // line 9: This line is intended to set the custom 'gas' variable, not the built-in 'gas'
    }

    function getGasCost() public view returns (uint256) {
        return gasleft(); // Using built-in function correctly
    }
}
```

### Description of the Vulnerability in the Generated Smart Contract
In the provided smart contract, the variable `gas` on line 6 shadows the built-in global variable `gas` in Solidity. The built-in `gas` variable is used to access the amount of gas remaining for the transaction, but in this contract, it has been overridden by a user-defined state variable. This can lead to confusion and errors in understanding the contract's behavior, as developers might expect `gas` to refer to the remaining gas for the transaction, not a user-defined value.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1**: Rename the user-defined variable to a more descriptive and unique name that does not conflict with any built-in global variables. For example, changing `gas` to `gasAmount` would avoid shadowing and make the code clearer:

    ```solidity
    uint256 public gasAmount = 10; // Renamed variable to avoid shadowing
    ```

- **Remediation 2**: Always use explicit and descriptive naming conventions for user-defined variables to prevent shadowing and improve code readability. Avoid using names that are too generic or that could potentially conflict with names in Solidity's global namespace. This practice should be part of the coding standards for Solidity development within your team or organization.

Implementing these remediations will help prevent the Built-in Symbol Shadowing vulnerability and make the smart contract code safer and easier to understand.
