This external call can fail intentionally or unintentionally. If the `highestBidder` is a contract that rejects incoming transactions or runs out of gas, it can cause the `bid()` function to fail. This can be exploited by an attacker who can make the contract unusable by continuously setting up conditions where the external call fails, effectively causing a Denial of Service (DoS) by clogging the contract with transactions that reach the block gas limit.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1: Use the Withdrawal Pattern**\n  Instead of transferring funds immediately back to the previous highest bidder within the `bid()` function, a safer approach is to record the amount to be refunded and allow the previous highest bidder to withdraw the funds themselves. This pattern minimizes the risk associated with external calls and puts the responsibility of handling gas costs on the caller, who wishes to withdraw their funds.\n\n- **Remediation 2: Implement Gas Limit Checks**\n  When making external calls, explicitly check and limit the amount of gas used for such calls. This can prevent the external call from consuming too much gas and potentially failing due to out-of-gas errors. However, this approach must be used cautiously as it might not completely mitigate the risk if the external contract is designed to fail transactions intentionally.\n\n- **Remediation 3: Use Reentrancy Guards**\n  Although not directly a solution to the gas limit issue, implementing reentrancy guards can prevent a variety of attacks where external calls could be used to re-enter the contract and manipulate its state. This is more of a general security practice but is beneficial in complex contracts where multiple external interactions occur.\n\nImplementing these remediations can significantly reduce the risk of DoS attacks due to block gas limit issues and improve the overall security and robustness of the smart contract.",
