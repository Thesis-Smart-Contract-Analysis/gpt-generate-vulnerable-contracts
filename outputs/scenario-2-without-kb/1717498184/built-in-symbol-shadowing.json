The built-in `gas` variable is used to access the amount of gas remaining for the transaction, but in this contract, it has been overridden by a user-defined state variable. This can lead to confusion and errors in understanding the contract's behavior, as developers might expect `gas` to refer to the remaining gas for the transaction, not a user-defined value.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1**: Rename the user-defined variable to a more descriptive and unique name that does not conflict with any built-in global variables. For example, changing `gas` to `gasAmount` would avoid shadowing and make the code clearer:\n\n    ```solidity\n    uint256 public gasAmount = 10; // Renamed variable to avoid shadowing\n    ```\n\n- **Remediation 2**: Always use explicit and descriptive naming conventions for user-defined variables to prevent shadowing and improve code readability. Avoid using names that are too generic or that could potentially conflict with names in Solidity's global namespace. This practice should be part of the coding standards for Solidity development within your team or organization.\n\nImplementing these remediations will help prevent the Built-in Symbol Shadowing vulnerability and make the smart contract code safer and easier to understand.",

Điều này có thể thay đổi hành vi mặc định của ngôn ngữ và gây ra các lỗi nghiệp vụ @zaazaa_2023_unveiling.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Built-in Symbol Shadowing vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
