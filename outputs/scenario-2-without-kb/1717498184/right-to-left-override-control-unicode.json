This character is used to reverse the visual representation of the characters that follow it in some text editors or IDEs. This can mislead developers or code reviewers about the actual logic or flow of the code, particularly the order of operations or the variables being manipulated. In this specific case, it could lead to confusion about which address is actually receiving the funds, potentially leading to security risks like unauthorized fund transfers.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1: Avoid Non-Printable Characters in Code**\n  - Ensure that the codebase is free from non-printable characters, especially those that can manipulate the visual representation of the code. This can be achieved by using linters or pre-commit hooks that scan and flag any such characters in the code.\n\n- **Remediation 2: Code Review and Pair Programming**\n  - Implement strict code review processes and consider pair programming practices, especially for critical parts of the code like financial transactions. This helps in catching any unusual code manipulations or hidden characters that a single developer might miss.\n\n- **Remediation 3: Use Solidity Linters and Static Analysis Tools**\n  - Utilize tools like Solhint or Slither, which can help in detecting suspicious patterns or characters in the code. These tools can be integrated into the continuous integration pipeline to ensure checks are automated and consistent.\n\n- **Remediation 4: Educate Developers**\n  - Conduct regular training sessions for developers on security best practices and common vulnerabilities in smart contract development, including the dangers of hidden characters and visual spoofing in code.\n\nBy implementing these remediations, the security of the smart contract can be significantly enhanced, protecting against vulnerabilities caused by the misuse of characters like the Right-To-Left Override.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Right-To-Left Override Control Character vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nKẻ xấu có thể sử dụng ký tự ghi đè phải sang trái (right-to-left override) có điểm mã (code point) là U+202E để thay đổi chiều hiển thị của các ký tự.\nKý tự này thường được dùng để che giấu phần mở rộng thực sự của tập tin nhằm đánh lừa người dùng. Ví dụ, khi sử dụng nó trong chuỗi `my-text.'U+202E'cod.exe` thì giá trị được hiển thị sẽ là `my-text.exe.doc` @u202e.\nỞ trong mã nguồn, ký tự U+202E có thể được sử dụng để thay đổi thứ tự của các đối số.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Right-To-Left Override Control Character vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
