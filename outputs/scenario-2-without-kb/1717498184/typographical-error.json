This typo will cause the contract to fail to compile, preventing deployment. If overlooked in a more complex system or if similar typos occur in non-critical parts of the code that do not prevent compilation, it could lead to incorrect logic execution or security vulnerabilities.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1**: Correct the typo in the function `checkBalance` by changing `balnces[user]` to `balances[user]`. This will fix the compilation error and ensure that the function correctly returns the balance of the specified user.\n\n- **Remediation 2**: Implement a robust code review and testing process. Before deploying smart contracts, they should undergo thorough reviews and testing by multiple developers. Automated tools such as linters and static analysis tools can also help detect such typographical errors early in the development cycle.",

The first part of the smart contract has a Typographical Error vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
