This range includes multiple major and minor releases of the Solidity compiler, each potentially having different optimizations, bug fixes, and even changes in the language syntax or semantics. Compiling the same contract with different compiler versions can lead to discrepancies in behavior, unexpected bugs, or security vulnerabilities, especially if a particular compiler version used contains unfixed bugs or deprecated features.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1: Specify a Fixed Compiler Version**\n  To avoid the risks associated with floating compiler versions, it is recommended to lock the smart contract to a specific compiler version that has been thoroughly tested and is known to be stable and secure. For example, changing the pragma line to `pragma solidity 0.8.4;` ensures that the contract can only be compiled with Solidity version 0.8.4.\n\n- **Remediation 2: Use Recent Compiler Versions and Regularly Update**\n  Regularly update the smart contract to use recent and stable compiler versions as they become available. This approach helps in leveraging the latest security fixes and optimizations provided by newer compiler versions. It is crucial to thoroughly test the contract each time the compiler version is updated to ensure that no new issues have been introduced.\n\nBy implementing these remediations, the smart contract's reliability and security can be significantly enhanced, mitigating the risks associated with floating compiler versions.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Floating Compiler Version vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nMột contract có thể được biên dịch bởi nhiều phiên bản của trình biên dịch khác nhau. Điều này có thể dẫn đến việc phiên bản được sử dụng lúc kiểm thử và lúc triển khai smart contract khác nhau. Nếu smart contract được triển khai bởi một phiên bản của trình biên dịch có chứa lỗi thì có thể làm ảnh hưởng đến tính đúng đắn của nó.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Floating Compiler Version vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
