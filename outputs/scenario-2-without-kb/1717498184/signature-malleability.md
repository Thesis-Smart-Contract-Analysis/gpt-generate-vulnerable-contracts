# Smart Contract with Signature Malleability Vulnerability

Here is an example of a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity that demonstrates a signature malleability vulnerability:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SignatureMalleability {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function verifyOwner(bytes memory signature) public view returns (bool) {
        bytes32 message = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("Verify Owner"));
        bytes32 ethSignedMessageHash = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32", message)
        );

        (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = splitSignature(signature);

        // Vulnerable line: does not check the signature's components for malleability
        address signer = ecrecover(ethSignedMessageHash, v, r, s); // line 16
        return signer == owner;
    }

    function splitSignature(bytes memory sig)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint8, bytes32, bytes32)
    {
        require(sig.length == 65, "Invalid signature length");

        bytes32 r;
        bytes32 s;
        uint8 v;

        assembly {
            r := mload(add(sig, 32))
            s := mload(add(sig, 64))
            v := byte(0, mload(add(sig, 96)))
        }

        return (v, r, s);
    }
}
```

### Description of the Vulnerability in the Generated Smart Contract

The vulnerability in this contract lies in the `verifyOwner` function, specifically at the line where `ecrecover` is used to recover the address from the signature. The issue here is that the signature components `v`, `r`, and `s` can be manipulated to produce a valid signature from a different signer without needing the private key. This happens because the contract does not validate whether the signature components fall within certain expected ranges or conditions that prevent malleability.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1: Enforce Canonical Signature Forms**
  Enforce that the `s` value of the signature is in the lower half of the secp256k1 curve's order. This can be done by checking if `s` is less than `secp256k1n / 2` (where `secp256k1n` is the order of the curve). If not, the signature should be considered invalid. This check ensures that only one of the two possible `s` values for each signature is considered valid, reducing malleability.

- **Remediation 2: Validate Signature 'v' Value**
  The `v` value, which indicates the recovery id, should be strictly checked to be either 27 or 28 (or 0 and 1 when dealing with contracts post EIP-155). This strict checking prevents using invalid `v` values that could potentially be part of a malleable signature.

Implementing these checks would significantly mitigate the risk of signature malleability in the smart contract.
