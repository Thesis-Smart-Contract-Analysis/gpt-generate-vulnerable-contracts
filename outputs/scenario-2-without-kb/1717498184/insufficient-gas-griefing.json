The vulnerability lies in line 14, where the external function is called without specifying a gas limit. This can lead to the Insufficient Gas Griefing vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate the transaction to provide just enough gas to reach this external call but not enough to execute it completely, causing it to fail and potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the `VulnerableContract`.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1: Specify Gas Limit**\n  To mitigate this vulnerability, you should specify a gas limit when making the external call. This can be done by using `.gas()` modifier on the function call. For example:\n  ```solidity\n  externalContract.performAction.gas(100000)();\n  ```\n  This ensures that the external call has a specific amount of gas, reducing the risk of the call failing due to insufficient gas provided by the transaction initiator.\n\n- **Remediation 2: Check Gas at the Beginning of the Function**\n  Another approach is to check if there is enough gas at the beginning of the function to complete the execution. You can estimate the required gas for the external call and assert that the remaining gas is sufficient before making the call:\n  ```solidity\n  function callExternalContract() public {\n      uint256 requiredGas = 100000; // Estimate of gas required for the external call\n      require(gasleft() > requiredGas, \"Insufficient gas for external call\");\n      externalContract.performAction();\n  }\n  ```\n  This method prevents the function from being called unless there is enough gas, thus avoiding the situation where the call is made with insufficient gas.\n\nImplementing either of these remediations will help protect the contract from the Insufficient Gas Griefing vulnerability, ensuring that external calls are made with adequate gas and reducing the risk of unexpected failures.",

Kẻ tấn công có thể cung cấp thiếu gas nhằm khiến cho lời gọi đến smart contract khác bị thất bại và làm kết quả của smart contract bị sai lệch.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Insufficient Gas Griefing vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
