The function `isContract` checks the code size of the address executing the call. However, during the construction phase of a contract, the code size (`extcodesize`) of the address is zero, even if it is a contract. This means that another contract could call `secureAction` in its constructor, bypassing the `onlyNonContract` modifier intended to restrict access to non-contract addresses.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1: Use Constructor Check**\n  Instead of relying solely on `extcodesize`, you can enhance the check by determining if the contract is in the process of being constructed. This can be indirectly inferred by checking if the `extcodesize` is zero but the transaction origin (`tx.origin`) is different from the message sender (`msg.sender`). This is not a foolproof method but adds an additional layer of security.\n\n- **Remediation 2: Delayed Functionality Activation**\n  Another approach is to delay the activation of certain functionalities until after the contract deployment is completed. For instance, you could add a time delay or require a specific \"activation\" transaction from the owner before sensitive functions become available. This prevents any contract from calling these functions during its construction phase.\n\n- **Remediation 3: Explicit Address Allowlisting**\n  Implement an allowlist mechanism where only verified and explicitly allowed addresses can interact with certain functions. This administrative approach requires maintaining a list of approved addresses, which can be cumbersome but offers high control.\n\nEach of these remediations has its trade-offs in terms of convenience, security, and gas costs, and should be chosen based on the specific requirements and threat model of your application.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Identity Verification vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nMột số smart contract kiểm tra xem một địa chỉ có phải là smart contract hay không thông qua opcode `extcodesize`.\nTuy nhiên, kẻ tấn công có thể thực thi hàm ở trong hàm tạo và vượt qua được cách kiểm tra trên. Lý do là vì trong quá trình hàm tạo thực thi, giá trị trả về của `extcodesize` sẽ là 0.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Identity Verification vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
