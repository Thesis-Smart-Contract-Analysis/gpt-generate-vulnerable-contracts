Both contracts declare a public state variable named `value`. This leads to a shadowing issue where the `DerivedContract`'s `value` variable shadows the `value` variable from `BaseContract`. As a result, when `value` is referenced in `DerivedContract`, it refers to `DerivedContract`'s `value`, not the `BaseContract`'s `value`. This can lead to confusion and errors in contract behavior, especially if the intention was to interact with the base contract's state variable.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1: Rename the Variable in Derived Contract**\n  To avoid shadowing, rename the variable in the derived contract to something unique that clearly indicates its purpose and distinguishes it from the base contract's variable. For example, changing `DerivedContract`'s `value` to `derivedValue` would resolve the shadowing issue.\n\n- **Remediation 2: Avoid Re-declaring Inherited Variables**\n  Simply do not re-declare the inherited variable in the derived contract. If you need to modify the inherited variable, you can directly set or modify the base contract's variable using `BaseContract.value` within the derived contract. This approach maintains clarity and ensures that there is only one `value` variable in the inheritance hierarchy.\n\nImplementing either of these remediations will help in avoiding the shadowing of state variables, thus making the smart contract code clearer and less prone to errors related to variable state management.",
