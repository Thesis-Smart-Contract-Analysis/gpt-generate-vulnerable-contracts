# Smart Contract with Function Selector Clashing Vulnerability

```solidity

contract VulnerableContract {
    // Assume this contract is used as a proxy that delegates calls to other contracts

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        // some logic to transfer amount to address 'to'
    }

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public {
        // some logic to transfer amount from address 'from' to address 'to'
    }

    function executeTransaction(bytes4 selector, bytes memory data) public {
        // This function is intended to delegate calls based on the selector
        (bool success, ) = address(this).delegatecall(abi.encodePacked(selector, data));
        require(success, "Transaction failed.");
    }

// The vulnerability is in the executeTransaction function where it uses delegatecall with a user-supplied selector.
```

### Description of the Vulnerability in the Generated Smart Contract
The `executeTransaction` function in the `VulnerableContract` uses a delegatecall with a user-supplied selector. This can lead to function selector clashing where two different functions have the same first 4 bytes of their keccak256 hash of their signatures. If an attacker can find or craft such a collision, they might be able to cause the contract to execute unintended logic. This is particularly risky in the context of a proxy contract, where the intended function to be executed might differ significantly in effect from the one actually called due to the selector clash.

# Remediations

- **Remediation 1: Use Full Function Signatures**
  Instead of allowing any arbitrary selector, modify the `executeTransaction` function to accept full function signatures and compute the selector within the contract. This reduces the risk of an attacker injecting a malicious selector.

  ```solidity
  function executeTransaction(string memory signature, bytes memory data) public {
      bytes4 selector = bytes4(keccak256(bytes(signature)));
      (bool success, ) = address(this).delegatecall(abi.encodePacked(selector, data));
      require(success, "Transaction failed.");
  }
  ```

- **Remediation 2: Whitelist Function Selectors**
  Implement a whitelist of allowed selectors that can be used with `executeTransaction`. This approach ensures that only predefined, reviewed, and safe function selectors are used in delegate calls.

  ```solidity
  mapping(bytes4 => bool) public allowedSelectors;

  function addToWhitelist(string memory signature) public {
      bytes4 selector = bytes4(keccak256(bytes(signature)));
      allowedSelectors[selector] = true;
  }

  function executeTransaction(bytes4 selector, bytes memory data) public {
      require(allowedSelectors[selector], "Selector not allowed.");
      (bool success, ) = address(this).delegatecall(abi.encodePacked(selector, data));
      require(success, "Transaction failed.");
  }
  ```

Both of these remediations aim to control and secure the use of function selectors in the context of delegate calls, particularly in proxy contracts, thereby mitigating the risk of function selector clashing.
