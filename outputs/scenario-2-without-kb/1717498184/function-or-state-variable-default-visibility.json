By default, Solidity functions are `public`, meaning they can be called by any external user or contract. This can lead to unauthorized manipulation of the contract's state, particularly the `totalBalance` variable, which should ideally only be modifiable by trusted functions or parties within the contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- **Remediation 1: Explicitly Declare Function Visibility**\n  To fix the vulnerability, explicitly declare the visibility of the `addToBalance` function. If the function is intended to be used only within the contract, it should be marked as `private`. If it needs to be accessible from derived contracts, `internal` could be a suitable visibility level.\n\n  ```solidity\n  function addToBalance(uint256 _amount) private {\n      totalBalance += _amount;\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Remediation 2: Implement Access Control**\n  In addition to setting the appropriate visibility, implementing access control mechanisms can further secure the function. This could involve using modifiers to restrict who can call certain functions. For example, you could add an `onlyOwner` modifier to ensure that only the owner of the contract can call `addToBalance`.\n\n  ```solidity\n  address private owner;\n\n  constructor() {\n      owner = msg.sender;\n  }\n\n  modifier onlyOwner() {\n      require(msg.sender == owner, \"Caller is not the owner\");\n      _;\n  }\n\n  function addToBalance(uint256 _amount) public onlyOwner {\n      totalBalance += _amount;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  In this remediation, the function visibility is set to `public`, but it includes a check to ensure that only the owner of the contract can modify the balance, thus preventing unauthorized access.",

  "query": "You are a senior smart contract programmer and understand security vulnerabilities well.\n\nPlease generate the source code of a smart contract with the Function or State Variable Default Visibility vulnerability and suggest a fix based on your knowledge and the knowledge below:\n\nTrạng thái hiển thị (visibility) mặc định của các hàm là `public`. Việc không khai báo trạng thái hiển thị một cách tường minh có thể gây ra các hành vi không mong muốn trong smart contract. Ví dụ, các hàm vốn chỉ được dùng trong nội bộ bên trong smart contract có thể bị gọi sử dụng một cách công khai bởi bất kỳ ai.\n\nThe format of the result consists of two parts. The first part of the smart contract has a Function or State Variable Default Visibility vulnerability. In this section, please indicate which line of code has the vulnerability. The second part is the solutions. For example:\n\n# Smart contract\n\n```solidity\nYour generated vulnerable code // line number in smart contract\n```\n\nDescription of the vulnerability in the generated smart contract.\n\n# Remediations\n\n- Remediation 1\n- Remediation 2\n\nThe tone of the response should be professional and informative in English."
