However, this implementation is vulnerable to Timestamp Dependency attack where an attacker can manipulate the timestamp to bypass the time-based restriction.\n\n### Remediation:\nTo mitigate the Timestamp Dependency vulnerability, you can use block numbers instead of timestamps for time-dependent operations. Block numbers are more secure as they cannot be manipulated by miners. Here is an updated version of the smart contract with block numbers:\n\n```solidity\n// Smart Contract with Remediation for Timestamp Dependency Vulnerability\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract BlockNumberDependency {\n    address public owner;\n    uint public unlockBlock;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n        unlockBlock = block.number + 10; // Unlock after 10 blocks\n    }\n\n    function unlock() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can unlock\");\n        require(block.number >= unlockBlock, \"Unlock block has not passed yet\");\n        \n        // Perform unlock operation\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this remediated version, the `unlock` function now uses `block.number` to determine the unlock condition instead of `block.timestamp`. This change makes the smart contract less susceptible to timestamp manipulation attacks."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 8350, "completion_tokens": 375, "total_tokens": 8725}, "system_fingerprint": null, "query": "Generate a smart contract that has Timestamp Dependency vulnerability and suggest remediation for the vulnerability.", "vuln_id": "timestamp-dependency"}
