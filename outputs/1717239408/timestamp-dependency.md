```solidity
// Smart Contract with Timestamp Dependency Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TimestampDependency {
    address public owner;
    uint public unlockTime;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        unlockTime = block.timestamp + 1 minutes; // Unlock after 1 minute
    }

    function unlock() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can unlock");
        require(block.timestamp >= unlockTime, "Unlock time has not passed yet");
        
        // Perform unlock operation
    }
}
```

In the above smart contract `TimestampDependency`, the `unlock` function allows the owner to unlock a certain operation after a specific timestamp. However, this implementation is vulnerable to Timestamp Dependency attack where an attacker can manipulate the timestamp to bypass the time-based restriction.

### Remediation:
To mitigate the Timestamp Dependency vulnerability, you can use block numbers instead of timestamps for time-dependent operations. Block numbers are more secure as they cannot be manipulated by miners. Here is an updated version of the smart contract with block numbers:

```solidity
// Smart Contract with Remediation for Timestamp Dependency Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BlockNumberDependency {
    address public owner;
    uint public unlockBlock;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        unlockBlock = block.number + 10; // Unlock after 10 blocks
    }

    function unlock() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can unlock");
        require(block.number >= unlockBlock, "Unlock block has not passed yet");
        
        // Perform unlock operation
    }
}
```

In this remediated version, the `unlock` function now uses `block.number` to determine the unlock condition instead of `block.timestamp`. This change makes the smart contract less susceptible to timestamp manipulation attacks.
