Below is a vulnerable smart contract that exhibits the Insufficient Gas Griefing vulnerability:

```solidity
// Vulnerable Smart Contract with Insufficient Gas Griefing Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract InsufficientGasGriefing {
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }

    function withdrawBalance() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw balance");
        balance = address(this).balance;
        owner.transfer(balance);
    }

    function() external payable {
        // Revert the transaction to consume less gas
        revert("Fallback function reverted");
    }
}
```

In the vulnerable smart contract `InsufficientGasGriefing`, the `withdrawBalance` function allows the owner to withdraw the contract's balance. However, an attacker can call the `withdrawBalance` function and force the transaction to revert by consuming less gas than required, resulting in a denial of service attack.

### Remediation:

To mitigate the Insufficient Gas Griefing vulnerability, you can implement a gas stipend in the withdrawal function to ensure that enough gas is provided for the transfer to complete successfully. Here is the remediated version of the smart contract:

```solidity
// Remediated Smart Contract with Gas Stipend to Mitigate Insufficient Gas Griefing Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract InsufficientGasGriefingRemediated {
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }

    function withdrawBalance() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw balance");
        balance = address(this).balance;
        (bool success, ) = owner.call{value: balance, gas: 2300}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }

    receive() external payable {}

    fallback() external payable {
        revert("Fallback function reverted");
    }
}
```

In the remediated smart contract `InsufficientGasGriefingRemediated`, the `withdrawBalance` function includes a gas stipend of 2300 gas to ensure that the transfer to the owner's address has enough gas to complete successfully. This prevents the attacker from causing a denial of service by consuming insufficient gas during the transfer.
