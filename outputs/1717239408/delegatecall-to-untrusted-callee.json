The `Attacker` contract has a `fallback` function that changes the `owner` variable in the `Proxy` contract to an address controlled by the attacker.\n\n### Remediation:\n\nTo remediate the Delegatecall to Untrusted Callee vulnerability, you should ensure that the `delegatecall` is only used to call functions in trusted contracts. Here is an example of how you can modify the `forward` function in the `Proxy` contract to include a whitelist of trusted contracts:\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract Proxy {\n\n  address owner;\n  mapping(address => bool) public trustedContracts;\n\n  constructor() {\n    owner = msg.sender;  \n  }\n\n  function getOwner() public view returns (address) {\n    return owner;\n  }\n\n  function addTrustedContract(address _contract) public {\n    trustedContracts[_contract] = true;\n  }\n\n  function forward(address callee, bytes memory _data) public {\n    require(trustedContracts[callee], \"Untrusted contract\");\n    (bool success, ) = callee.delegatecall(_data);\n    require(success);\n  }\n\n}\n\ncontract Attacker {\n    \n  address owner;\n\n  fallback() external { \n    owner = 0xB514b2e847116c7B57e0BFac3a180eB049cd395c;\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\nIn the remediated version, the `Proxy` contract now includes a `trustedContracts` mapping where trusted contracts can be added. The `forward` function now checks if the callee contract is in the list of trusted contracts before performing the `delegatecall`. This ensures that only trusted contracts can be called using `delegatecall`."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 8355, "completion_tokens": 537, "total_tokens": 8892}, "system_fingerprint": null, "query": "Generate a smart contract that has Delegatecall to Untrusted Callee vulnerability and suggest remediation for the vulnerability.", "vuln_id": "delegatecall-to-untrusted-callee"}
