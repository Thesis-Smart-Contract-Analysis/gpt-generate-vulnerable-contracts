Here is a vulnerable smart contract with the Function or State Variable Default Visibility vulnerability:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {

  function withdrawWinnings() {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0. 
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() {
    msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
     
}
```

In this smart contract, the `_sendWinnings` function is not explicitly declared with a visibility modifier, which means it defaults to `public`. This can lead to unintended behavior where anyone can call the `_sendWinnings` function to withdraw ETH from the contract without needing to meet the condition specified in the `withdrawWinnings` function.

### Remediation:
To fix the Function or State Variable Default Visibility vulnerability, you can explicitly specify the visibility modifier for each function and state variable. In this case, you can update the smart contract as follows:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract HashForEther {
  
  function withdrawWinnings() public {
    // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0.
    require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
    _sendWinnings();
  }
  
  function _sendWinnings() internal {
     msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }

}
```

By explicitly setting the visibility modifier for the `_sendWinnings` function to `internal`, you ensure that it can only be called from within the contract and not externally. This helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive functions within the smart contract.
