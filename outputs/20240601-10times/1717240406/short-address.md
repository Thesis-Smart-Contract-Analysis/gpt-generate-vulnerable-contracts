```solidity
// Smart contract with Short Address Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ShortAddressVulnerability {
    
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
    
}
```

In the above smart contract, the `transferOwnership` function allows the owner to transfer ownership to a new address. However, it is vulnerable to the Short Address Attack. This vulnerability occurs when a malicious user sends a transaction with a short address (less than 20 bytes) to the `transferOwnership` function. The EVM pads the short address with zeros to make it 20 bytes long, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

### Remediation:

To mitigate the Short Address Vulnerability, you can add a check to ensure that the length of the address passed to the `transferOwnership` function is exactly 20 bytes. Here is the remediated version of the smart contract:

```solidity
// Smart contract with Remediation for Short Address Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ShortAddressVulnerabilityFixed {
    
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        require(_newOwner != address(0), "Invalid address");
        require(_newOwner == address(uint160(_newOwner)), "Invalid address length");
        
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
    
}
```

In the remediated version, the `transferOwnership` function now includes additional checks to ensure that the new owner address is not the zero address and has a length of exactly 20 bytes. This helps prevent the Short Address Vulnerability from being exploited.
