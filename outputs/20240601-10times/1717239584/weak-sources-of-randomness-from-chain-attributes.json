However, using `block.timestamp` for generating random numbers is not secure as it can be manipulated by miners to some extent.\n\n## Remediation:\n\nTo mitigate the Weak Sources of Randomness from Chain Attributes vulnerability, you can use an external source of randomness such as an Oracle service or Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to generate secure random numbers.\n\nHere is an example of how you can integrate Chainlink VRF into the smart contract:\n\n```solidity\n// Smart contract with Secure Randomness using Chainlink VRF\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nimport \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBase.sol\";\n\ncontract SecureRandomness is VRFConsumerBase {\n    bytes32 internal keyHash;\n    uint256 internal fee;\n    uint256 public randomNumber;\n\n    constructor(address _vrfCoordinator, address _link, bytes32 _keyHash, uint256 _fee) \n        VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator, _link)\n    {\n        keyHash = _keyHash;\n        fee = _fee;\n    }\n\n    function getRandomNumber() public {\n        require(LINK.balanceOf(address(this)) >= fee, \"Not enough LINK tokens\");\n        requestRandomness(keyHash, fee);\n    }\n\n    function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness) internal override {\n        randomNumber = randomness % 100;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the remediated smart contract, we are using Chainlink VRF to securely generate random numbers. The `fulfillRandomness` function is called when the random number is generated by Chainlink VRF, and the `randomNumber` is calculated securely."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 8356, "completion_tokens": 448, "total_tokens": 8804}, "system_fingerprint": null, "query": "Generate a smart contract that has Weak Sources of Randomness from Chain Attributes vulnerability and suggest remediation for the vulnerability.", "vuln_id": "weak-sources-of-randomness-from-chain-attributes"}
