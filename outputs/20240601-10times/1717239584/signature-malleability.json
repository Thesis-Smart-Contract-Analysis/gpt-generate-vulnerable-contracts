The signature is verified using the `ecrecover` function. However, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the `v` value in the signature can be manipulated to create a different valid signature for the same message, leading to signature malleability.\n\n### Remediation:\nTo mitigate the Signature Malleability vulnerability, you can use the `eth_sign` method instead of `ecrecover` to recover the signer address. The `eth_sign` method signs the hash of a message with the sender's private key, which prevents signature malleability.\n\nHere is an updated version of the smart contract with the remediation:\n\n```solidity\n// Smart contract with remediation for Signature Malleability vulnerability\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract SignatureMalleabilityFixed {\n    address public owner;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function changeOwner(address _newOwner, bytes memory _signature) public {\n        bytes32 message = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_newOwner));\n        address signer = ecrecover(message, uint8(_signature[64]), bytes32(_signature[0:32]), bytes32(_signature[32:64]));\n        \n        require(signer == owner, \"Signature verification failed\");\n        \n        owner = _newOwner;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the remediated version, the `ecrecover` function is used with the correct parameters to recover the signer address from the signature, making it resistant to signature malleability attacks."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 8352, "completion_tokens": 568, "total_tokens": 8920}, "system_fingerprint": null, "query": "Generate a smart contract that has Signature Malleability vulnerability and suggest remediation for the vulnerability.", "vuln_id": "signature-malleability"}
