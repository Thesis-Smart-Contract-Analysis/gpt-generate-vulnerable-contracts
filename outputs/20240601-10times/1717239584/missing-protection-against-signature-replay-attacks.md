In the smart contract `TransferFunds` above, the `transfer` function allows the owner to transfer funds to a recipient by verifying a signature provided by the owner. However, there is a vulnerability in the signature verification process that can lead to a Signature Replay Attack.

## Vulnerability Description

A Signature Replay Attack occurs when an attacker captures a valid signature from a legitimate transaction and then replays that signature to perform unauthorized transactions. In this case, the attacker can intercept a valid signature from a legitimate transfer transaction initiated by the owner and then use that same signature to replay the transaction multiple times.

## Remediation

To prevent Signature Replay Attacks, it is important to include a nonce or a unique identifier in the signed message to ensure that each signature can only be used once. By adding a nonce to the message that is signed by the owner, the signature becomes specific to that particular transaction and cannot be reused.

Here is an updated version of the `TransferFunds` contract with nonce implementation:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TransferFunds {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public nonces;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function transfer(address payable recipient, uint amount, uint nonce, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can initiate transfers");
        
        require(nonces[msg.sender] == nonce, "Invalid nonce");
        
        bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(recipient, amount, nonce));
        address signer = ecrecover(hash, v, r, s);
        
        require(signer == owner, "Invalid signature");
        
        recipient.transfer(amount);
        
        nonces[msg.sender]++;
    }
}
```

In the updated contract, a `nonce` is included in the message that is signed by the owner. The `nonce` is incremented after each successful transfer to ensure that each signature is unique and cannot be replayed. This helps prevent Signature Replay Attacks by making each signature specific to a single transaction.
