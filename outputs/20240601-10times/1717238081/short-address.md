```solidity
// Smart contract with Short Address Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ShortAddressVulnerability {
    
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
    
}
```

In the above smart contract, the `transferOwnership` function allows the owner to transfer ownership to a new address. However, it is vulnerable to the Short Address Attack. This vulnerability arises when a malicious user sends a transaction with a short address (less than 20 bytes) to the `transferOwnership` function. The EVM pads the short address with zeros to make it 20 bytes long, and this can lead to unexpected behavior.

### Remediation for Short Address Vulnerability

To mitigate the Short Address Vulnerability, you can implement a check to ensure that the address passed to the `transferOwnership` function is of the correct length. Here is an updated version of the smart contract with the remediation:

```solidity
// Smart contract with Remediation for Short Address Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ShortAddressVulnerabilityFixed {
    
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        require(_newOwner != address(0) && _newOwner == address(uint160(_newOwner))); // Check for correct address length
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
    
}
```

In the remediated version, the `transferOwnership` function now includes a check to ensure that the `_newOwner` address is not a zero address and has the correct length (20 bytes). This check helps prevent the Short Address Vulnerability by ensuring that only valid addresses can be used to transfer ownership.
