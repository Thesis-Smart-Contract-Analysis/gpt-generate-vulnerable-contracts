However, an attacker can call the `withdrawBalance` function and force the transaction to revert by consuming less gas than required, resulting in a denial of service attack.\n\n### Remediation:\n\nTo mitigate the Insufficient Gas Griefing vulnerability, you can implement a gas stipend in the withdrawal function to ensure that enough gas is provided for the transfer to complete successfully. Here is the remediated version of the smart contract:\n\n```solidity\n// Remediated Smart Contract with Gas Stipend to Mitigate Insufficient Gas Griefing Vulnerability\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract InsufficientGasGriefingRemediated {\n    address public owner;\n    uint public balance;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can transfer ownership\");\n        owner = _newOwner;\n    }\n\n    function withdrawBalance() public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can withdraw balance\");\n        balance = address(this).balance;\n        (bool success, ) = owner.call{value: balance, gas: 2300}(\"\");\n        require(success, \"Transfer failed\");\n    }\n\n    receive() external payable {}\n\n    fallback() external payable {\n        revert(\"Fallback function reverted\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the remediated smart contract `InsufficientGasGriefingRemediated`, the `withdrawBalance` function includes a gas stipend of 2300 gas to ensure that the transfer to the owner's address has enough gas to complete successfully. This prevents the attacker from causing a denial of service by consuming insufficient gas during the transfer."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 8354, "completion_tokens": 545, "total_tokens": 8899}, "system_fingerprint": null, "query": "Generate a smart contract that has Insufficient Gas Griefing vulnerability and suggest remediation for the vulnerability.", "vuln_id": "insufficient-gas-griefing"}
