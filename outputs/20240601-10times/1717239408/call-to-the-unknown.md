```solidity
// Smart Contract with Call to the Unknown Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        
        // Call to an unknown address
        (bool success, ) = _newOwner.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("receiveOwnership()"));
        require(success, "Transfer ownership failed");
        
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
    
}
```

In the `transferOwnership` function of the `VulnerableContract`, there is a call to an unknown address using the `call` function. This can lead to unexpected behavior as the function `receiveOwnership()` in the unknown address may not exist or may have malicious code.

### Remediation:

To fix the Call to the Unknown vulnerability, you should avoid calling unknown addresses directly. Instead, you can implement a whitelist of trusted addresses that the contract can interact with. Here is an updated version of the `VulnerableContract` with a whitelist:

```solidity
// Smart Contract with Remediation for Call to the Unknown Vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SafeContract {
    
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => bool) public allowedAddresses;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can call this function");
        _;
    }
    
    modifier onlyAllowed() {
        require(allowedAddresses[msg.sender], "Address not allowed to call this function");
        _;
    }
    
    function addAllowedAddress(address _address) public onlyOwner {
        allowedAddresses[_address] = true;
    }
    
    function removeAllowedAddress(address _address) public onlyOwner {
        allowedAddresses[_address] = false;
    }
    
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public onlyAllowed {
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
    
}
```

In this updated version, the `SafeContract` maintains a whitelist of allowed addresses that can call the `transferOwnership` function. The `onlyAllowed` modifier ensures that only addresses in the whitelist can execute the function. This approach helps prevent unauthorized or malicious calls to unknown addresses.
