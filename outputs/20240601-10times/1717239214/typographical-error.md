```solidity
// Smart contract with Typographical Error vulnerability

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TypoVulnerable {
    uint public balance;

    function depoist(uint _amount) public {
        balance += _amount;
    }
}
```

In the smart contract above, there is a typographical error in the function name `depoist` instead of `deposit`. This can lead to unintended behavior and potential vulnerabilities in the contract.

### Remediation:

To fix the Typographical Error vulnerability, you should correct the function name to match the intended function name. Here is the remediated version of the smart contract:

```solidity
// Smart contract with TypoVulnerable vulnerability remediated

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TypoVulnerableFixed {
    uint public balance;

    function deposit(uint _amount) public {
        balance += _amount;
    }
}
```

By correcting the function name to `deposit`, you ensure that the function is called correctly and avoid any unintended behavior due to typographical errors.
