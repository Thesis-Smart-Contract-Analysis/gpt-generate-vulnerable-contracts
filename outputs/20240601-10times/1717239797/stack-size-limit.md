```solidity
// Smart contract with Stack Size Limit vulnerability
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract StackSizeLimit {
    
    uint256 public result;
    
    function calculate(uint256 input) public {
        result = recursiveFunction(input);
    }
    
    function recursiveFunction(uint256 input) private returns(uint256) {
        if(input == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        return input + recursiveFunction(input - 1);
    }
}
```

In the smart contract above, the `recursiveFunction` is a recursive function that keeps calling itself until the input reaches 0. This can lead to a Stack Size Limit vulnerability if the input is too large, causing the stack to grow beyond the limit and resulting in a stack overflow.

### Remediation:
To remediate the Stack Size Limit vulnerability, you can refactor the recursive function to an iterative function. By converting the recursive function to an iterative one, you can avoid the risk of exceeding the stack size limit.

Here is the remediated version of the smart contract:

```solidity
// Smart contract with remediated Stack Size Limit vulnerability
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract StackSizeLimitRemediated {
    
    uint256 public result;
    
    function calculate(uint256 input) public {
        result = iterativeFunction(input);
    }
    
    function iterativeFunction(uint256 input) private returns(uint256) {
        uint256 sum = 0;
        for(uint256 i = 1; i <= input; i++) {
            sum += i;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

In the remediated version, the `iterativeFunction` calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to the input value in an iterative manner, avoiding the recursive call and the associated risk of stack overflow.
