```solidity
// Smart contract with Outdated Compiler Version vulnerability
pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract OutdatedCompilerVersion {
    uint public data;

    function setData(uint _data) public {
        data = _data;
    }
}
```

## Remediation:
To address the Outdated Compiler Version vulnerability, you should update the Solidity compiler version to the latest stable version. Here is the updated smart contract with the latest Solidity compiler version:

```solidity
// Smart contract with updated Solidity compiler version
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UpdatedCompilerVersion {
    uint public data;

    function setData(uint _data) public {
        data = _data;
    }
}
```

By updating the Solidity compiler version to the latest stable version (in this case, `^0.8.0`), you ensure that the smart contract is using the most recent features, optimizations, and security enhancements provided by the Solidity team.
