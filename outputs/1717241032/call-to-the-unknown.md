Below is a vulnerable smart contract that has the Call to the Unknown vulnerability:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        (bool success, ) = _newOwner.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("receiveOwnership()"));
        require(success, "Ownership transfer failed");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
}
```

In the `transferOwnership` function of the `VulnerableContract`, the contract attempts to call a function `receiveOwnership()` on the address `_newOwner` without verifying if the function actually exists in the contract at that address. This can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the function `receiveOwnership()` is not present in the contract at the address `_newOwner`.

### Remediation:

To remediate the Call to the Unknown vulnerability, you should follow these best practices:

1. **Use Interface**: Define an interface that specifies the functions that the `_newOwner` contract must implement. This way, you can ensure that the function being called actually exists in the contract.

```solidity
interface IOwnership {
    function receiveOwnership() external;
}

contract VulnerableContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        IOwnership newOwnerContract = IOwnership(_newOwner);
        newOwnerContract.receiveOwnership();
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
}
```

2. **Use Known Function**: Instead of dynamically calling a function using `call`, explicitly call a known function in the `_newOwner` contract to transfer ownership. This way, you ensure that the function being called is known and expected.

```solidity
contract VulnerableContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        IOwnership newOwnerContract = IOwnership(_newOwner);
        newOwnerContract.transferOwnership(msg.sender);
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
}
```

By following these remediation steps, you can mitigate the Call to the Unknown vulnerability in your smart contract.
