This can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the function `receiveOwnership()` is not present in the contract at the address `_newOwner`.\n\n### Remediation:\n\nTo remediate the Call to the Unknown vulnerability, you should follow these best practices:\n\n1. **Use Interface**: Define an interface that specifies the functions that the `_newOwner` contract must implement. This way, you can ensure that the function being called actually exists in the contract.\n\n```solidity\ninterface IOwnership {\n    function receiveOwnership() external;\n}\n\ncontract VulnerableContract {\n    address public owner;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can transfer ownership\");\n        IOwnership newOwnerContract = IOwnership(_newOwner);\n        newOwnerContract.receiveOwnership();\n        owner = _newOwner;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. **Use Known Function**: Instead of dynamically calling a function using `call`, explicitly call a known function in the `_newOwner` contract to transfer ownership. This way, you ensure that the function being called is known and expected.\n\n```solidity\ncontract VulnerableContract {\n    address public owner;\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Only the owner can transfer ownership\");\n        IOwnership newOwnerContract = IOwnership(_newOwner);\n        newOwnerContract.transferOwnership(msg.sender);\n        owner = _newOwner;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy following these remediation steps, you can mitigate the Call to the Unknown vulnerability in your smart contract."
